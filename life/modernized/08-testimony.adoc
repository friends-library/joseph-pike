[short="Testimony of the Meeting of Cork"]
== The Testimony of the Meeting of Cork, Concerning Joseph Pike

It having for some time past lain on the minds of various Friends,
that something by way of testimony concerning that worthy elder,
our dear deceased friend, Joseph Pike, might be of service,
we hope a few lines relating thereto will not be thought unseasonable at this time.

He was the son of Richard and Elizabeth Pike,
who were early convinced of the blessed Truth,
and continued zealous for it and faithful to the end,
he dying a prisoner for his testimony thereunto.
It pleased the Lord in his great love, to visit this our dear friend in his tender years,
being under eight years of age, and by his Holy Spirit strove with him,
to bring him off from the vanities that childhood and youth are incident to,
and until he was twelve or thirteen years of age.
About this time, that honourable elder, William Edmundson,
came to visit Munster Province, by whose ministry at a meeting in Cork,
the Lord`'s heavenly power took hold of him,
opening to him his inward state and condition,
which begat in him earnest cries to the Lord,
that by the help of his Holy Spirit he might be enabled
to come into obedience for time to come.
And as he grew in years,
and was brought into obedience to the workings of Truth in his own heart,
he found a concern upon his mind to join with faithful Friends in church discipline,
for which service it pleased the Lord to gift him in an eminent manner,
as appears by some manuscripts written some time before his departure,
as also by that excellent treatise on Baptism and the Supper;
and on many occasions showing himself to be a man of a universal spirit.

As a good steward of the grace and gift received,
he was faithfully and zealously concerned for the holy name and testimony of the Lord,
that the line of judgment without partiality might be kept up,
and over that spirit that has long and does still
endeavour to lay waste the Lord`'s work,
by introducing a false liberty into the church; he being,
from the time of his first admittance into meetings for business,
preserved from joining with or strengthening the hands of any loose, disorderly spirits,
but on the contrary, had a testimony in his heart against them to his dying day.
He was a good example in duly attending meetings for worship,
and sincerely devoted himself to the serving of Truth: constantly,
for many years together, attending the National Half-yearly Meeting at Dublin,
and often the Yearly meeting at London, where he was both acceptable and serviceable,
and even sometimes when the circumstances of his family
might have been a reasonable excuse for his staying at home.
But his love to Truth and concern for the prosperity thereof outbalanced other considerations;
and some of us, who were intimately acquainted with him for many years,
are witnesses of that deep exercise and travail of
soul he laboured under for Zion`'s sake;
more especially of late years since the removal of many
of our worthy and faithful elders from among us,
under a sense and consideration how few in the present age come up in their places.
It may truly be said of him,
that he preferred the welfare and peace of the church before his chiefest joy;
taking great delight in hearing when the affairs thereof went well,
particularly in hearing any account of young men coming up in a right concern for Truth.

He was a man of a clear understanding, and sound judgment and impartiality;
tender over the weak, where tenderness appeared,
but sharp against the high-minded and stubborn, though nearly related.
Much might be said of the many excellent qualifications
with which it pleased the Lord to favour him;
of which favours he was truly sensible, and oftentimes,
in great awfulness and brokenness of spirit,
humbly acknowledging his own unworthiness of the great love
and goodness of God extended towards him every way,
both inwardly and outwardly.
In conduct solid and weighty, without affectation,
yet cheerful and agreeable without levity.
A worthy elder, ruling his own house well, and of great service in the church,
as is well known to many that yet remain,
who are more and more sensible of the church`'s loss in his removal.

And as he had often desired,
that he might have a short and easy passage out of this world, he had his desire granted;
for after a lingering weakness which had attended him for several years,
he was suddenly taken with a fit of illness, and in a few minutes departed this life,
the 7th day of the eleventh month, 1729; and we doubt not,
he is entered into that rest which is prepared for the faithful.
