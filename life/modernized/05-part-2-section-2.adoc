=== Section II.

1692+++.+++ About this time, and indeed several years before, our dearly beloved friend,
and elder brother in the Lord, William Edmundson, with other faithful elders,
had a deep concern and travail of soul for a general reformation
in many things that were amiss among Friends;
not only relating to disorderly conduct, but also to the encumbrance of the world,
and too eagerly pursuing it,
likewise as to the superfluity of apparel and household furniture,
with other things that were fast creeping upon us.
To prevent which,
minutes of advice against such things had been given
forth from several Half-year`'s Meetings;
but hitherto, they had not had the desired effect in many particulars; so that now,
the Lord brought a zealous concern upon many Friends, both elder and younger,
throughout the nation, to join heartily in endeavouring for this reformation;
and among the rest,
my dear friend and cousin Samuel Randall and myself joined heart and soul in this concern.

There were many Friends who had gone out into extravagant furniture and apparel,
to please and gratify a fine, nice mind, which,
as the Lord`'s Spirit led us to put away in the beginning,
so it will never lead us to take them up again; and whoever goes into them,
does so far go from the leadings of Truth, and wherever I see it,
the testimony of Truth arises in my heart against it.
Truth allows liberty enough for all the conveniences of life, in moderation,
according to our circumstances in the world,
without unnecessary and superfluous adornings,
according to the customs and fashions of this world, to please a vain mind.

Most of our wives (such as were of ability) at that time wore silk clothing,
though of a pretty plain colour, and other costly apparel;
and we had some pretty fine furniture and household stuff,
things which were inconsistent with the simplicity of the Truth,
and are apt to steal away the mind into a love of them.

I do not esteem it an evil in itself to wear plain silk clothes,
provided the mind be not affected with a delight in them,
and especially in a climate which requires it;
nor do I believe that many who wear them are as proud of them as some who wear none.
But the ill tendency lay here, that from plain colours some got lighter colours,
others exceeding them adopted variable ones.
Thus they followed one another`'s example,
until at length they came to such fashionable colours and patterns, that,
when I was in some parts of England,
I could not know by their apparel some women who
were called Friends from those who were not.
And with sorrow, I speak the same also of some men Friends,
both by their vain fashionable apparel and excessively
fine and superfluous household furniture.

Fearing the increase of such consequences here,
Friends were conscientiously made willing to lay aside superfluous things;
agreeably to the apostle Paul, who said, "`All things`" (that is,
those that are good things) "`are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient;
all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not;`" and for this reason,
he denied himself of very lawful things, lest he should embolden others to offend.
It is not enough to say, "`Why should we deny ourselves these things,
if we do not pride ourselves in them, which in themselves are the creatures of God,
for the sake of those who run into the extravagant abuse of them?
If this were a sufficient argument,
by the same rule we might deny ourselves of necessary clothing
and other good things of all kinds in the creation,
since almost every good thing is abused.`"
But there is a very great difference between such
good and lawful things which we cannot live without,
for the support of life, and such as we can live comfortably without.

after she had given up to obey the Divine call from the fashions of the world,
thus writes:--

I am sensible that silks, ribbons and lace,
are not anywhere in Scripture directly forbidden, but I learn, from there, that pride,
and all manner of superfluity, is.
And if by wearing this rich silk,
or adorning ourselves with the other superfluous ornaments, we feed and nourish a proud,
vain desire, it becomes by this circumstance as unlawful as pride itself;
and that they do so, I have greatly experienced.
For though religion stands not simply in clothes,
yet true religion stands in that which sets bounds and limits
to the mind with respect to clothes as well as other things.
And to strengthen this assertion, or rather, to prove it,
I shall offer an instance of my own experience.

When it pleased the Lord to visit my soul, and to appear to me in his glory,
the view of which discovered to me my own unworthiness,
and caused me not only to despise and abhor myself, but my splendid apparel also.
I had now no delight in dress and ornament,
nor other things I had usually taken much pleasure in: true Christianity,
which I began to be acquainted with, set a bound to my desires,
and directed me to plainness,
before I had any intention of joining the Society of the people called Quakers;
and indeed,
all earthly and transitory objects were and are in
my view and estimation as loss and dross,
in comparison of the excellency, glory,
and beauty I beheld in God and find in the enjoyment of his Divine favour,
and at times I am ready to cry out, "`O how great is his glory,
and transcendently great his beauty!`"--See Sophia
Hume`'s Address to the Inhabitants of South Carolina, p. 24.--Editor.]

Now, although Friends in Ireland had not gone into such great excess of superfluities,
as some elsewhere had done, yet we were too fast following them; and in all probability,
had gone much further than we did,
if the Lord had not thus stirred up the heart of that man of God,
William Edmundson and some others among us, who, from a deep pressure of spirit,
moved our Half-year`'s Meeting in this year, 1692, to send forth,
in addition to former advices, larger minutes,
by way of counsel against many hurtful things,
which had gradually crept into the church in this nation;
some of these I purpose mentioning here, as a memorial to stir up others to their duty,
to keep out of such things,
that I am fully satisfied the testimony of truth and the Lord`'s Spirit is against,
and will be to the end of time.

+++[+++The ancient Christians, +++[+++writes another of the primitive Friends, Ambrose Rigge,]
did not study those arts of splendour and gallantry,
with which the professed Christians are now overrun, as stately palaces,
costly furniture, rich hangings, fine tables, curious beds, vessels of gold and silver,
"`the very possession of which,`" as Clement of Alexandria says, "`creates envy.`"
"`Our Lord,`" continues he, "`eat his food out of a common dish,
and made his followers sit upon the grass, and washed his disciples`' feet,
without ever fetching down a silver bowl from heaven:
he took the water which the Samaritan woman had drawn in an earthen pitcher,
not requiring one of gold, showing how easy it was to quench his thirst.
For he respected the use, not the vain and superfluous state of things.`"

"`The garments that we should wear,`" says the same early Christian writer,
who lived about two hundred years after Christ, "`ought to be mean and frugal,
not curiously wrought with various colours, the emblems of craftiness and deceit;
_that_ is true simplicity of apparel, which takes away what is vain and superfluous,
and _that_ is the best and most solid garment, which is furthest from art and curiosity,
and most apt to preserve and keep warm the body.`"]

We were pressingly recommended, in the first place, to the worship of God in spirit,
and to diligent meeting together on week days, as well as first-days, and when there,
to have our minds exercised towards the Lord, watching against a sleepy, drowsy spirit.
The right education of our children in the fear and nurture of the Lord,
was also impressed upon us, and to avoid over fondness or indulgence towards them,
by which many children had been ruined.
It was further advised, that when they were of an age fit for employment,
both male and female, they should be kept at suitable work and labour, out of idleness,
and not to give them fine clothes, which would beget in them a high, proud mind,
with many other particulars, such as keeping out of the finery and fashions of the world,
which lead from God.
We were further advised to be plain in our apparel, furniture, and speech,
according to Truth, and to avoid extremes in the multiplicity of business, farming,
trading, and commerce, also against a multiplicity of words in bargaining, or otherwise,
and against lightness or airiness in gestures, postures, or otherwise.
Solid deportment in conduct, at home and abroad, was likewise recommended;
and that the plain language of Truth might be kept to, with many other things,
both at this time and at succeeding Half-yearly Meetings.
As those advices had not proved so effectual as was desired,
the Half-year`'s Meeting recommended,
that every Province Meeting should appoint _clean-handed and faithful_ Friends,
who had a true concern for a reformation in these things,
to inspect and visit every particular meeting, family, and person; and thereupon,
as they found occasion, to advise, exhort,
and admonish Friends to a compliance with the minutes which had gone forth.

When the aforesaid minutes came to our meeting, relative to the nomination,
Samuel Randall and myself, with our dear Friend and elder Thomas Wight,^
footnote:[This individual compiled the history of the Society in Ireland,
afterwards completed by J. Rutty.
There is an interesting narrative of his convincement in that volume, p. 279,
and in Piety Promoted, some account of his death.]
and some others, were appointed to the service;
and although we heartily united with Friends in the concern, yet I can sincerely say,
we thought ourselves very weak and unworthy of the office,
yet complied with the desire of the Province Meeting.
But before my dear cousin Samuel and I joined in the visit, the first thing we did,
was to cleanse our own houses of some superfluity, which, for Truth`'s sake,
we were made willing to part with; and our dear wives also, joined in spirit with us.
As to our own clothing, we had but little to alter,
having both of us been pretty plain in our garb,
yet some things we did change to greater simplicity.
But my dear cousin, being naturally of a very exact and nice fancy,
had things in more curious order as regards household furniture than I had;
and therefore, as a testimony against such superfluities,
and that spirit which led into it, he altered or exchanged, as I did,
several articles that were too fine.

We both had fallen into the prevailing practices around us, upon our first house-keeping;
at which time there was, in a general way, but little said against such things,
being pretty common among Friends, especially in great towns,
one taking pattern from another, and often exceeding each other,
till they came to this pass.
Our fine veneered and garnished cases of drawers, tables, stands, cabinets, scrutoires,
etc., we put away, or exchanged for decent plain ones of solid wood,
without superfluous garnishing or ornamental work;
our wainscots or wood-work we had painted of one plain colour,
our large mouldings or finishings of pannelling, etc.; our swelling chimney-pieces,
curiously twisted banisters, we took down, and replaced with useful plain wood-work,
etc.; our curtains, with valances, drapery, and fringes that we thought too fine,
we put away or cut off; our large looking-glasses with decorated frames, we sold,
or made them into smaller ones;
and our closets that were laid out with many little
curious or nice things were done away.

We thoroughly reformed our houses; and if any should think,
that we placed religion barely in outward conformity and plainness,
such are greatly mistaken; so far from it,
that if we should outwardly conform in everything,
in which the Holy Scriptures direct us unto,
or that godly elders are moved of the Lord to advise; yet,
if our hearts are not right in His sight,
and we do not witness a growth in His holy Truth,
all the external conformity and plainness in the world, though good in itself,
will avail us nothing as to Divine acceptance; no more,
than as the apostle tells the believers, that if he gave his body to be burned,
or his goods to the poor, etc., yet, if he lacked love,
(which is the love of God,) all would profit him nothing,
and he would be as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.
1 Cor. 13.

However, notwithstanding religion does not consist in bodily conformity,
or plainness of apparel, but is in and from the heart, as also, on the other hand,
pride is in the heart, and not in the outward clothing,
yet true religion leads into simplicity in all outward things.
For though there is a form of godliness without the power,
yet the power of Truth leads into a godly form and order in outward things;
and this is abundantly proved from the Holy Scriptures, and among the rest,
even in outward clothing.
Thus, did true religion in the heart lead our first elders and fathers in the church,
out of the fashions, customs, finery, and superfluity of apparel, and furniture,
and to testify against it, as not proceeding from the Spirit of Truth, but from the vain,
unsettled spirit of this world, as it most certainly does.

But some cavillers have thus argued,
"`Where is the standard of plainness and simplicity in apparel, furniture, etc.,
by which we are to square ourselves,
or who are the proper judges to whom we should submit ourselves?
How many buttons are we to wear, more or less, on our coats;
what exact fashion in length and breadth are the parts of our clothes to be of;
how high are our hats to be, or how broad the brims?
And do not you, who press upon us this great plainness,
differ among yourselves in your practice?
And are not some things you wear, when strictly examined, not needful?
After all, we are each best judges for ourselves; we will see for ourselves,
and do as we wish, and not be imposed upon by your injunctions.`"
These were the arguments used, to my certain knowledge, by the old separatists,
who in these and various other respects strongly
pleaded for what they called their Christian liberty;
but at last they dwindled away, and came to nothing.
And some from the very same spirit use the same language now.

As to the standard and judge they demand, I answer,
the Spirit of Truth is sufficient to guide in these and all other things.
Thus the apostles from the Spirit of Truth advised
the believers not to be conformed to this world,
not to fashion themselves according to their former lusts,
not to adorn themselves with outward adorning, costly array, etc.
And thus the same Spirit led our first elders and worthies to keep to plainness,
and to testify against running into and following after the customs, fashions,
and finery of this world.
As to that frivolous objection,
that plain Friends do not all go exactly alike in these respects,
they never desired nor pressed a precise conformity in every trivial thing,
provided there was a care and tenderness preserved to keep from edging towards,
or copying vain and foolish fashions; and if the objectors differed only from plainness,
so far as plain Friends differ from each other,
and kept within the bounds of true moderation, no fault would be found with them.

With regard to the question, "`Who shall judge or decide such things?`"
Certainly not those who gratify a high, vain spirit,
in using such things as grieve faithful Friends,
and who have themselves known but little of the work of Truth upon their hearts.
The most proper outward judges in these things are rather such as are spiritual men,
whose eyes are single to the Lord, and whose bodies, as says Christ, are full of light;
these, as the apostle writes, judge all things, but themselves are judged of no man,
that is, of no carnal man.
Such are good examples to the flock of God,
and having nothing in view but his honour and the good of souls, may be safely followed,
and we are bound to submit ourselves to them.
As to these objectors not seeing evil in these things,
or being convinced of this or that, it may be said of them, "`They seeing, see not,
neither do they understand;`" and it will be long before they,
while they continue in this state and spirit,
can rightly see the things that belong to their peace and safety and growth;
and it is preposterous in them to pretend matter of conscience to wear and use gay clothing, etc.

I shall now proceed to remark on church government and discipline,
both in primitive times, as well as in our own,
in order to show those who may lack information,
that we are warranted by Scripture in the practice thereof; and that,
as the Holy Spirit of God led the apostles into church government then, so likewise,
we being still under the same Gospel dispensation,
and the same necessity for discipline still remaining,
have been led by the same Spirit to follow their example therein.

It is undeniably plain from Scripture, that there were governors in the church then,
as well as such who were to be governed by them: and indeed,
if we speak after the manner of men, even in outward communities and societies,
those who pretend to be members of such,
ought to be subject to the rules and orders of the society; but if they be fractious,
and transgress the regulations thereof,
they thereby cut themselves off from the privileges of that society.
Thus also, and much further,
I think the parallel holds good in relation to our religious Society,
in the good order and government of the church,
in those things relating to doctrine and practice, which are not repugnant to,
but are agreeable to Scripture.
For if every unruly or disorderly person were left to their own liberty,
to do and act as they please, or to advance doctrine contrary to what we believe,
and this without dealing with, or controlling them,
I say such forbearance might justly render us accountable for such actions or doctrines.
We might also bid farewell to all just pretences
to be the true members of the body or church of Christ;
and instead thereof, be rendered a confused, distracted body,
drawing and dividing confusedly, some one way and some another,
until at length those who were not guided by Truth,
would run out into the wide sea of the world.

As God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, in all the churches of the saints,
we find church discipline began with the very beginning of the church; and that,
as the believers increased,
so elders and overseers were appointed in all places for services in the church,
as the apostle Paul said to Titus; "`For this cause left I you in Crete,
that you should set in order the things that are lacking,
and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you,`" ch.
1 ver. 5. These elders were, in the first place, to take heed to themselves,
and be good examples to the flock, as the apostle Paul said,
"`Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock,
over the which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers.`" Acts 20:28.
And the apostle Peter says, "`The elders which are among you, I exhort,
who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, etc.;
feed the flock of God, which is among you, taking the oversight thereof,
not by constraint, but willingly, neither as being lords over God`'s heritage,
but being examples to the flock.`" 1 Pet. 5:1.
And Paul says to Timothy, "`These things command and teach.
Let no man despise your youth; but be an example of the believers, in word, in conduct,
in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
Take heed unto yourself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them.`"
1 Tim. 4:11, etc.
Then as to the manner of dealing with sinners, and doing all things impartially,
he says thus, "`Them that sin, rebuke before all, that others also may fear.
I charge you, before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels,
that you observe these things without preferring one before another,
doing nothing by partiality.`" 1 Tim. 5:20.
From all which it appears,
that most of the things which the apostles commanded
or recommended to the elders and overseers,
are now in our day under the care of the church.

They advised the believers not to forsake the assembling
of themselves together for the worship and service of God;
they advised to preach sound doctrine, and to oppose and withstand that which is false;
they advised to Christian duties, under all stations, to holiness in all their conduct;
to bridle their tongues; their words to be few and savory, seasoned with grace;
they advised to humility and lowliness of mind, and against pride and height,
and not to adorn themselves with putting on of apparel, broidered hair,
and wearing of gold, and pearls and costly array, but on the contrary, to modest apparel,
and the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit.
They advised to diligence in business, and against idleness and sloth, against tattling,
and being busy bodies, and also flattery, against the love of the world and things of it,
too eager pursuit of riches, covetousness, etc.; on the contrary,
to charity and liberality,
and especially that the rich of this world be rich in good works, and to be humble,
blameless, harmless, as the sons of God, ever following that which is good, just,
and honourable.
They advised the believers to be of one mind and one heart, to be easily entreated,
and to mark such as cause divisions and give offences,
that such be warned and sharply reproved.

These things and much more, relating to conduct and behaviour,
and using the things of the world, the apostles, in their several epistles,
gave forth by the movings of the Holy Spirit to the churches.
And we find, they mentioned superfluous things, that were worn and used in their days,
which will comprehend those things that are now recommended
by the churches of Christ or godly elders in our day.
The apostle Paul charges, to abstain from all appearance of evil;
whether they eat or drank or whatever they did, to do all to the glory of God;
not to be conformed to this world, but to be transformed by the renewing of their mind;
as obedient children,
not fashioning themselves according to their former lusts in their ignorance;
not to give any offence to the Jews or Gentiles, neither to the church of God;
to submit themselves one to another, in the fear of God;
likewise the younger to submit themselves to the elder; yes,
all to be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility.
Thus they were to put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh,
to fulfill the lusts thereof.

It is very plain, that these texts include all things,
that were in any respect likely to prove hurtful.
As we are commanded to abstain from all appearance of evil,
we should also abstain from every appearance of pride, which manifests itself in fine,
fashionable furniture, houses, and dresses of all kinds,
which most certainly lead thereto.
And as we are commanded, whatever we do, to do all to the glory of God,
we are not to be conformed to the world in adorning our bodies, but instead thereof,
we should be clothed with humility, letting our moderation be known to all men;
giving no offence to the church of God.
In a word, such texts plainly show,
that all those who are true members of the church of Christ,
ought not to wear or use any of those things which grieve or offend the church;
and as the younger were to be subject to the elder, and they to one another,
so it utterly excludes all such from abounding in their own strong will,
contrary to the advice and counsel of the church.

And again, we are commanded, to obey them that have the rule over us,
and submit ourselves; inasmuch as they watch for our souls,
as those that must give an account; that they may do it with joy, and not with grief, Heb. 13:17.
"`And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you,
and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; and to esteem them very highly in love,
for their works`' sake.`" 1 Thess. 5:12-13.
"`Let the elders that rule well,
be counted worthy of double honour;
especially they who labour in the word and doctrine,`" 1 Tim. 5:17. "`Remember
them which have the rule over you,`" Heb. 13:7. "`Salute all them that have
the rule over you,`" ver. 24. From these texts it is undeniably plain,
that there were elders in the primitive church,
who were to oversee and rule the church of God,
and the flock were obliged in Christian duty to be obedient to them.
And as the Lord ordered it so then, he has, in his Divine wisdom,
led his church into the same godly order now, by elders and overseers,
whom he has gifted for the same services, and who are concerned in spirit to advise,
counsel, exhort, and reprove, as occasion offers,
to keep out of all hurtful things that draw away from the Lord.

Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ himself, in the days of his flesh,
laid down the method of proceeding with offenders, thus, "`Take heed, to yourselves;
if your brother trespass against you, rebuke him; and if he repent,
forgive him,`" Luke 17:3. "`Moreover, if your brother shall trespass against you,
go and tell him his fault between you and him alone; if he shall hear you,
you have gained your brother.
But if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two more,
that in the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be established.
And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church;
but if he neglect to hear the church,
let him be unto you as a heathen man and a publican,`" Matt. 18:15, etc.

Here then, it appears, that private dealing for private faults is first to be used;
though private faults may be great, yet if they are not publicly known,
private labour should be first used; but if they are publicly known,
especially if they be such as relate to faith and doctrine,
we have an example from Christ himself to his disciples.
"`And when he (Christ) came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them,
and the Scribes questioning with them.
And he asked the Scribes,
'`What are you discussing with them?`' And one of the multitude answered and said,
'`Master, I have brought unto you my son, which has a dumb spirit:
and I spoke to your disciples that they should cast him out,
and they could not.`'`" This public instance brought
in question the power of faith in the disciples;
and he answered and said,
"`Oh faithless and perverse generation! how long shall I be with you and bear with you?
Bring him unto me,`" Luke 9:41. This was a public rebuke, on a public occasion:
and thus the apostle Paul dealt with the apostle Peter,
in a case that in some respects affected the doctrine of the church,
by telling the church of Galatia, which was far distant from Antioch.
Paul says, "`When Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face,
because he was to be blamed,`" and that before them all, Gal. 2;
and see also 1 Tim. 5:20. "`Them that sin rebuke before all,
that others also may fear.`"
So that, in some cases, according to the nature and circumstances of things,
public rebuke may be more proper than private.

We find the holy apostles dealt very tenderly with penitent sinners,
but on the other hand to the obstinate and unruly they were at times very sharp;
and the Holy Spirit leads to the same in our day.
"`If a man be overtaken in a fault, you who are spiritual,
restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering yourself,
lest you also be tempted.`" Gal. 6:1.
Thus, when any are overtaken with a temptation, the spiritual man,
who knows the frailties of human nature,
endeavours in the spirit of meekness to restore such.
And Christ spoke of joy in heaven, over the repentant sinner,
in the parable of the prodigal son, who, upon his repentance and return,
was joyfully received by his father.
Many such instances we have in Scripture, showing the Lord`'s mercy to repentant sinners;
but, while they continue in hardness of heart, they are not in a state of forgiveness.
"`If any man`" (says the apostle,) "`obey not our word by this epistle, note that man,
and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed; yet count him not as an enemy,
but admonish him as a brother.`" 1 Thess. 3:14.
And for this reason we cannot countenance or have fellowship,
with those who reject the counsel of Friends.

"`Now, we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly,
and not after the tradition which he received of us.`" 2 Thess. 3:6.
This signifies such as did not observe the rules and orders given them.
"`Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.`" Eph. 5:11.
"`I beseech you brethren, mark them who cause divisions and offences,
contrary to the doctrine which you have learned; and avoid them.`"
Rom. 16:17, that is, have no fellowship, (have no unnecessary conversation) with them.
"`Now, we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly,`" etc.
1 Thess. 5;14. "`Rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith.`"
"`These things speak and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.`"
Titus 1:13, and 2:15. "`I would they were even cut off which trouble you.`" Gal. 5:12.
These texts may suffice to show the manner and way,
that the apostles used and directed, in dealing with offenders;
but where they could not be reclaimed by such Christian reproof,
in order to prevent scandal to the church, they were directed to be censured and denied.

Now, Christ has given his true church great power on earth, "`Verily I say unto you,
whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,
and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.`"
The transgressor first cuts himself off, by not hearing the church,
then the church does its incumbent duty,
in declaring to the world that they disown him to be of their society: and yet,
if he repent and acknowledge his fault, I think it is plain from the text,
that the church has power to loose him again.
And this method the apostles followed, after Christ`'s ascension,
in casting out of the church such obstinate offenders and evil doers,
as would not hear the church and be reclaimed.
Paul speaking of some who had made shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, says,
"`Of whom are Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan,
that they may learn not to blaspheme.`" 1 Tim. 1:20.
"`A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition,
reject.`" Titus 3:10.
This heretic I take to be one who held false doctrines, and this rejecting,
was to make him, unto the church, as a heathen man and a publican.

Thus I have shown by Scripture the manner and method of dealing with and censuring offenders,
together with the order and government practised in the church in the primitive times;
wherein we have in measure followed their example, being led by the same Holy Spirit.
And I am so firmly established in my belief,
that they were set up by the immediate moving and power of the Lord,
that if I saw the likeness or appearance of an angel from heaven,
who preached a liberty contrary to church government,
as practised in the primitive times, and now again, in a good degree, renewed in our day,
it would be no more in my power to believe that he was sent from God,
than to believe that I am now bodily dead, while I am writing this;
agreeably to what the apostle says, "`Though we, or an angel from heaven,
preach any other Gospel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you,
let him be accursed.`" Gal. 1:8.
And I further add, that I never saw any thrive or grow in the Truth,
who opposed the discipline of the church; but on the contrary, grew dead, dry,
and senseless, as to the things of God.

I have been thus large, as relating to church government and discipline, and have,
in several places, mentioned that our first elders and fathers in the Truth,
testified against the finery and fashions of the world,
as being contrary to the leadings of the Holy Spirit of Truth.
I shall only refer to the works of that man of God, and worthy elder, George Fox;
and particularly to his 250th and 397th Epistles,
where he warns and advises all Friends against pride, haughtiness, and high-mindedness,
and not to let the eye of their mind run after and follow the changeable customs,
and new invented fashions of the world, neither to take delight in apparel,
so as to deck and adorn the body with fine and costly array;
for such like things lift up the mind and lead from God, to quench his Spirit,
slight his Truth, and mold them into unity with the world`'s spirit.
He pressingly advises all Friends to lowliness and humility of mind,
to plainness of apparel,
and to keep down that spirit which leads into the fashions of the world,
that therein they may judge the world;
for though the world is in the practice of these things themselves, yet,
if Friends follow them, the world itself will judge them, which it really does.

When some have been spoken to for wearing costly apparel with fashionable dresses,
contrary to the plainness of Truth; they have answered that they do not see,
nor are they convinced of any hurt or evil in them, but when they do,
they will put them away; and some have added,
that no one can charge them with any evil or immoral practices in their conduct;
that religion does not consist in these trivial things;
that Friends ought not to make so much ado about them.
I refer such to that excellent treatise of Robert Barclay`'s upon Church Government,
called The Anarchy of the Ranters, etc., in which he cites this very plea,
calls it the "`wisdom of man,
and deceitfulness of the serpent,`" which would reason Truth from themselves, saying,
"`I must stay until I be convinced of this, that, and the other thing.
I see not yet this thing to be wrong, or the other thing to be my duty.`"

How did our elders knock down this manner of reasoning, by the Spirit of God.
I desire all such to consider in the light of Truth, what is the cause,
that they lack sight and conviction in so very plain a case.
It was the Holy Spirit of Christ that led our ancient Friends, in their first steps,
to take up the cross and deny themselves of the vain fashions, customs, manners, speech,
apparel, and needless ceremonies of the world; and by these outward marks,
as well as by other things, they were distinguished from other professors.
While we have such a cloud of witnesses, is it not wonderful,
that at this time of the day, they should pretend a lack of light and conviction;
yet supposing they do not really see, let them consider,
whether it is not because of their unwillingness
to give pure obedience to the cross of Christ,
by which they would see, that the lack of clearness in things of plain duty,
may proceed from lack of faithfulness to what we do know, or might know; as Christ says,
"`He that has been faithful in a few things, shall be made ruler over many things.`"
As to pleading morality, etc., this, I confess, is so far well,
but that alone will not do; because a man cannot be a right Christian,
without being a good moralist; but yet a man may be a moralist,
without being an acceptable Christian in the sight of the Lord.
I suppose none,
who plead for and wear such fine and fashionable things as grieve faithful Friends,
will pretend to say, that they are more spiritual, or see further into the things of God,
than the apostles did, or our first elders have done; neither,
that the Holy Scriptures do justify them in the practice of such things.
If this be granted, which I think cannot be denied, it follows,
that as the apostles and our elders were more spiritual,
and from the movings of the Holy Spirit advised to plainness, they,
together with those who in sincerity follow their example, are in the right,
and those on the opposite side are in the wrong.

And as to the objection of things being small and trivial,
and that religion does not consist in plainness, I have already allowed,
that religion does not consist therein; but yet, as proceeding from a sincere mind,
obedience in them is one of the effects of pure religion,
or the Holy Spirit would not have led the apostles in their day,
and the elders in our day, so repeatedly to press plainness, etc.
And indeed the wisdom of God is great, as seen by those who walk in the light,
in leading our first elders into plainness,
and out of the fashions and ceremonies of the world.

Forasmuch, as there are degrees of growth in the Truth, as fathers, young men,
and children, and that some do not see as far as others; so I shall show by Scripture,
there lies an absolute obligation on such as are less spiritual,
to follow the counsel and example of the apostles and elders,
until they see further into the things of God,
in order to preserve the unity of the body, the church of Christ.
He himself prayed for his disciples, that they might be one,
as he and his Father were one; and Paul to the Ephesians beseeches the church,
that they walk worthy of their vocation,
"`endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.`"
In accordance herewith, Robert Barclay says,
that there is no greater property in the church of Christ, than pure unity of spirit,
which yet admits of different growths and measures, but never contradictory ones.
And, in order to the maintenance and preservation of this unity and oneness,
the apostle Paul repeatedly recommends the church, to be all of one mind;
speak the same thing; to be of one accord,
and perfectly joined together in the same mind and judgment,
and that there should be no contrariety or divisions among them.
They were not only to be advised, governed, and obedient to the apostles and elders,
but they were also to follow their example.
"`Those things which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do;
and the God of peace shall be with you,`" Phil. 4:9. Paul recounts
unto them his own experience and progress in the way of righteousness,
and his pressing on to perfection,
to the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus, and says,
"`Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded; and,
if in anything you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.
Nevertheless, whereunto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule,
let us mind the same thing.
Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so,
as you have us for an example.`"
Phil. 3:15, etc.

From these texts it is to be observed,
that to those who are otherwise minded from the apostles, and yet tender in spirit,
the Lord would in due time reveal these things,
as they press on to further spiritual attainments.
It could not be expected, that the weaker children should see as the fathers did,
and therefore, Paul is positive, that they should walk by the same rule,
and follow their examples.
And Robert Barclay observes largely upon the foregoing texts, in the same treatise,
and shows that,
"`Where any shall arise to teach and practise things
contrary to such as are already received as true,
and confirmed by God`'s Spirit in the hearts of the saints,
whether in principle or practice, however small in themselves,
such things are to be judged and condemned:`" consequently,
though finery and fashions are by some accounted small things, yet,
as they have been testified against by the apostles, and also by our elders,
through the Spirit of God, they are accordingly to be judged and condemned.

This discourse on church discipline is much longer than I intended;
especially as relates to fashions and finery, because these are spreading,
and many have been hurt by going into them.
I hope it may give information to some, who may read it with an unbiased mind,
and though I have repeated Scripture texts and subjects in some places,
and therefore some may judge me guilty of tautology, yet I have purposely done it,
in order to impress upon the minds of my readers that which I have advanced from Scripture,
and from the testimony of our first elders, etc.
We find in the Holy Scriptures the same things several times repeated,
even in the same chapter, in order to fix them deeper in our minds,
for our benefit and instruction; I have taken this method,
in this discourse as to church government and discipline,
and I do in much love and good will,
recommend what I have written to the serious consideration of all the impartially minded.

I shall now return to the relation of our procedure upon visiting
families by appointment of the Province Meeting in the year 1692.
Having, as before mentioned, cleared our own houses and families of superfluities,
as we thought the plainness of Truth required, we then proceeded to visit others,
and the method of our procedure was thus.
We first met together, being six or seven in number;
and after waiting for a time in silence upon the Lord, every one,
as he found it on his mind, spoke what appeared to him suitable on the occasion;
and in a tender, brotherly manner,
every one of us freely submitted ourselves to one another; how far,
each stood clear as to life and conduct and other matters: as also,
whether we ourselves had complied with the rules of the Society.
For in our conference together, we told one another,
that if we were not good examples ourselves, we were not fit to advise others:
and in our discourse, we were very plain and free with each other in the love of God.

I can say of a truth, our hearts were greatly humbled before the Lord,
under a sense of the great weight of the concern,
and our own weakness and unworthiness for such a service;
yet as we were appointed thereto,
and with a deep concern of mind for the prosperity of Truth,
and the welfare of those whom we were to visit, we proceeded accordingly,
and visited every Friend`'s family,
and those who attended our meetings in the city of Cork.
In doing which, we first sat down with them together;
and as we found a concern to come upon our minds,
suitable to their respective states and conditions, we gave them advice and counsel,
etc.; and particularly to keep close to the witness of God in themselves,
the gift and measure of his Holy Spirit,
by which they might come to know and experience a growth in the Lord`'s holy Truth,
whereby the inside would be made clean, and then the outside would be made clean also.

After we had spoken what was in our minds relating to spiritual things,
we then proceeded to other things relating to conduct and behaviour, etc.,
as occasion offered.
Then we read sundry rules of superior meetings,
and spoke the needful to those rules and advices, without partiality to any.
And I can in great humility of mind say,
the Lord owned us in our service by the attendance of his living presence,
which in several places broke in upon our spirits and some of theirs also,
bowing their hearts into great tenderness.
Some who had not been so faithful to Truth,
nor so orderly in their conduct as they ought to have been,
were so reached by what was spoken, that in much brokenness of mind,
they acknowledged the same, with desire that for the time to come,
they might be more faithful to the Lord, and walk more circumspectly.
And indeed we had very melting seasons in many places,
all which greatly strengthened and confirmed us in our service and labour of love;
and I do not know that we met with any opposition
or stubbornness in all the places we visited,
but a general condescension in all,
to put away superfluities in apparel and household furniture,
which was accordingly done some time after.
So that there was a pretty thorough reformation in this city as to things
that appeared contrary to Truth and the rules of the Society.
And I must further add,
that in all our visits we did not meet with as much opposition and stiffness,
as has been the case of latter time from some young men,
who must bear their own burdens in the day of the Lord,
though at present they bring trouble and burdens upon the faithful.

Much of the stubbornness and stiffness in children who are grown up, is owing to fond,
and indulgent parents, some of whom desire well for their children, and as Eli did,
advise and counsel them,
but still they have not restrained them according to their power; and this was his sin,
and the cause of the destruction of his sons.
These permit them, through their foolish and evil fondness, to get head,
and to grow up in disobedience, and when dealt with by concerned Friends,
they will tell them, "`We must not be too harsh and severe upon our children;
we must bear with them, and draw them by love, lest we drive them out from among Friends:
we hope they will grow wiser and better in time.`"
These and the-like fond arguments, we have met with: but by means of this forbearance,
such a strong spirit of rebellion has grown up in them,
that at last they have become so unruly and stubborn, as to be above advice, rule,
or government.

And here I would warn all such indulgent parents to repent thereof; otherwise,
I verily believe the blood of their children will be required at their hands.
I have compared a child to a young twig that is easily bent,
but when grown to a sturdy tree is past bending.
Children when young being prone by nature to evil, are to be kept in subjection;
and as soon as anything of pride, looseness, or other evil appears in them,
that is the time for bending and restraining them,
so far as it is in the power of parents to do, and which is most certainly their duty,
as may be plainly proved from Scripture.

In the beginning of the year 1693, or the latter end of the preceding one,
I joined with some other appointed Friends,
in making a visit through this province where Friends lived.
From Cork we went to Charleville, then to Limerick,
so through the county of Tipperary to Cashel and some other small meetings in the country,
to Clonmel and Waterford, and back through Youghal.
In this visit, the Lord`'s living presence attended us,
and we returned home with satisfaction and comfort,
in that we had sincerely discharged our consciences, without partiality.
In most places we found a general condescension,
with the exception of some few dark and earthly spirits,
who were accordingly admonished and reproved, agreeably to the trust reposed in us.

From that year to the present,
we have visited the families and particular persons in this city several times,
as we had done before, and twice Friends went through the province.
But notwithstanding there appeared, as before mentioned,
a pretty general condescension and reformation among Friends at that time;
yet with sorrow of heart I may say, that now as of old, when Moses, Joshua,
and the elders were dead, "`there arose another generation,
many of whom knew not the Lord,
nor the works he had done for Israel,`" so a young
generation has of late arisen among us,
who have not known the powerful workings of the Lord`'s Spirit,
but through a desire of liberty, have crept into some things which we had put away,
to the grief and trouble of the faithful, many of whom are gone to their rest,
and some are still alive in body and spirit.
And though great endeavours have been used with some, by admonition and reproof,
yet they still continue regardless of the advice and counsel of elders.
However I am not without hope, that in the Lord`'s due time, by his assistance,
and his blessing upon the endeavours of the faithful, who labour in the Spirit of Truth,
that some of them will be brought off from the error of their ways.
This visit to Friends`' families was likewise performed in the other provinces,
and had the same effect,
so that there was in some time a pretty general reformation as to outward things.

I shall now have occasion to speak of the service of visiting Friends`' families,
and particular persons, and likewise answer some objections made against it.
There are two sorts of Friends who judge this method of visiting; the one more directly,
and the other are tenderly afraid that it is too formal.
The first are libertines though pretended Friends, who are against all church discipline,
that would abridge them of their undue liberty; and therefore,
it is no wonder they should be against visiting families,
which admits of more close dealing, and which they cannot endure,
being the very reverse to their libertine inclinations;
therefore I deem it to no purpose to address them,
in order to prove the service of these visits.

The second sort, are such who are honest-minded,
and who approve of the discipline of the church and dealing with offenders;
yet not being acquainted with the method of visiting families,
tenderly fear lest we should run into too much formality,
and thereby neglect the immediate teachings of the Holy Spirit.
They say,
"`We cannot understand that church officers should be formally and indifferently chosen,
and appointed out of the meeting,
some of whom may be perhaps very much unqualified for such a service,
not having a true and divine sense upon their spirits,
therefore we fear this method of yours will lead into the form, without the power;
neither do we see the necessity for it,
since we have public preaching by the power of Truth,
and our ministers are often led to speak to these particular things,
that you put those indifferently chosen Friends upon speaking to; and besides this,
we have meetings for discipline which answer the same intention of dealing with offenders,
without those visits; for these, and similar reasons we see not the service of them.`"

These objections I have myself heard made in some places where such visits are not practised,
and by some honest-minded Friends, for whose sakes more especially I write this,
and shall make some answer thereto.

If any meeting should nominate or appoint any of its members,
without due regard to their spiritual qualifications, I shall unite in the fear,
that such would lead into the form without the power of Truth; and yet at the same time,
the power of Truth leads into the true form and right order in all such things;
but I have more charity than to believe,
that any meeting esteemed to be of the true church of Christ,
having a number of qualified, sensible members fit for such appointments,
would be so void of spiritual sense,
as to appoint for service any but those who have first a concern upon their spirits,
and from this concern in themselves,
are enabled to speak to matters as they find occasion.

Such a church of Christ, consisting of qualified sensible members, fit to choose,
being spiritual men who,
according to Scripture "`judge all things,`" having spiritual eyes to see,
and spiritual discernment to discover, do not only judge from the outward appearance,
but from spiritual sense also;
being often led to speak closely to the inward states of such,
as could not be blamed for their conduct, or external things,
and yet are seen in the light of Truth, to stand in need of counsel,
relating to their inward growth.
And, these visitors did, in the first place,
chiefly recommend the absolute necessity of their being led by the Spirit of Truth;
that without this, neither the profession of Truth, nor coming to meetings,
nor the strictest outward conformity would avail, as to their acceptance with the Lord;
and that they should attend to the measure of the gift of the Spirit in themselves,
which, if obeyed,
would lead all those who are in the practice of outward
things that may be disagreeable to Truth,
into a reformation; and will lead all those who are not blameable in that respect,
to a closer walk with God.

From what I have now said, it may appear,
that honest-minded Friends need not to be fearful of what they call formality;
for true discipline in the church, and those visits in particular,
when performed by the leadings of the Spirit, are but true public preaching confirmed,
and made more effectual by being sent home to the particular persons.

Thus a minister of Christ, preaching against pride, height, vanity,
and following the fashions and customs of the world; drinking to excess; company-keeping;
too eagerly pursuing after the world, and abundance of other matters,
which they may particularly name,
if any of the auditory be guilty of those things which they preach against,
the less guilty being tender in spirit, take their part to themselves,
and sometimes more than a part, while the hardhearted have often put off the testimony;
like the hypocrite that Christ spoke of, who could see the mote in his brother`'s eye,
yet could not discern the beam in his own.
These will say, "`I am not so guilty of such a thing, as such and such are,
therefore this testimony does not belong to me as much as to some others.`"
And thus they will elude the whole and shift it off from themselves,
by which the public testimony becomes not so effectual,
as if they had been plainly told by visitors, "`You are the man that is guilty of this,
that, or the other thing, contrary to the leadings of the Spirit of Truth.`"

And this way of particular dealing,
has sometimes proved more effectual than public preaching,
which we have experienced in these visits; some being reached by close dealing,
and have with sorrow confessed their offences.
Thus it proved with David, who read and understood the outward law,
and well knew he had transgressed against it,
yet he was not brought by the law which was public, to so near a sense of his great sin,
as when Nathan came and said unto him, "`You are the man.`"
Then it was that he was brought to a true sense of his great transgression,
and confessed the same and, upon his repentance the Lord forgave him.
Therefore I think it is very plain,
that private visits strengthen and confirm public testimonies,
and church discipline also.
I grant that public offences, in their proper season,
should be brought before the church, in order that such offenders should be dealt with,
by appointing some of their members to visit them,
although they may have been helped by private advice and counsel,
given them by these visitors; yet several going together by the authority of the church,
carry more weight, and sometimes this proves more effectual.

I believe no person of right understanding,
can make it a matter of conscience to wear fine apparel,
or to have fine furniture in their houses, instead of plain:--not that I am,
or ever was against decency,
or that the rich and poor should have all conveniences of life precisely alike,
for that which may be suitable for the rich, may not be so for the poor,
whose circumstances cannot afford it; but still the rich, as well as the poor,
should keep within the bounds of Truth and moderation.--Truth led,
and still leads into plainness.

It must be allowed that many who come to our meetings,
especially honest-minded young people, who are pretty orderly in their conduct,
some of whom may be better than others who are plainer;
are yet too fine in their apparel,
and are in the practice of some outward things that godly elders see are hurtful to them,
taking up too much room in their hearts, and obstructing their growth in the Truth,
though they themselves are not sensible of it.
These have often heard public testimonies against such things,
and perhaps some particular Friends have likewise spoken to them,
and yet all has not proved effectual,
though they are not stiff or stubborn as many others are;
but they are so glued to the inclination of finery,
that they cannot part with those things which tend to their hurt.
Here, neither public preaching nor particular advice has prevailed with such;
yet those visitors have succeeded,
by laying before them what the Holy Spirit led our first elders out of, and into,
relating to the vain fashions, customs, and ceremonies of the world,
and to testify against them: as they themselves might observe,
that wherever any were rightly convinced of Truth,
and came into the true obedience to it, the very first steps into which it led them,
were to take up the cross in these things;
and if they minded the gentle leadings of this Spirit, it would lead them to do likewise.
These things being recommended to their serious consideration in the light of Truth,
have so far opened the understandings of some,
as to make them willing to part with many things,
which were a hindrance to the growth of the good seed of the kingdom.

But some may object against this conformity, if it be without conviction.
I answer, there is no need of conviction in this case,
it being no matter of conscience to have and wear fine and fashionable things,
instead of plain;
it then results into matter of condescension to the advice and counsel of worthy elders,
to which they are absolutely enjoined by Scripture,
or to what purpose do the Scriptures repeatedly advise thereto?
And our worthy, esteemed Friend and brother Robert Barclay largely proves by Scripture,
the conformity of church government or discipline to the mind of Christ,
as well as the necessity of condescension and submission to elders,
etc. and that the church of Christ has power to give a positive sentence,
etc. relating to matters of conscience.
To this treatise, namely, his Anarchy of the Ranters, I refer my reader,
believing it to be one of the most excellent works which treat of Church
Government that has been written since the apostles`' days.
However, let none mistake me in what I have said,
as if I intended that those who are unruly or disorderly in their conduct in other respects,
should be advised to outward conformity in plainness while they remain so.
No; these are to be dealt with another way, and if they cannot be reclaimed,
I would rather choose they should go in their flaunting, fashionable dresses,
and appear as they really are,
by which they would not bring a greater reproach upon Truth and Friends.

But, on the other hand, I am indeed for endeavouring to prevail upon the orderly,
to condescend to the advice of solid Friends, which it is their duty to do,
even by Divine authority;
and their condescension may produce good effects upon themselves and others;
for laying aside and parting with these things,
has been a means to prevent the growing of that inward root of pride,
from which it first proceeded.
For the evil arises first in the heart; yet we very often see,
that where outward objects prevail too much upon the mind, they promote temptations,
but when these objects are removed, and the cross taken up to them,
in many cases the temptation is removed.
As we have by sad experience seen the ill effects of bad example,
and that many grow worse and worse in following them; so on the other hand,
good examples in plainness,
etc. have become an encouragement to others to follow their steps.

And then, this plainness, whether from conformity to the advice of elders,
etc. or whether immediately arising from the power of Truth,
in those whose minds were formerly taken up with too much finery, has proved,
and may prove, some check to the obstinate, who are deaf to all sorts of advice,
whether public or private;
and who have in some measure strengthened themselves
in opposition and arguments against Friends,
by producing such and such for examples in some of the things they wear and use, who,
they tell us, are nearer to Friends than they are.
I say, this conformity, whether instrumentally or immediately,
takes away the occasion of the pretences of these unruly people.

To conclude upon what I have said with regard to family visits,
I shall leave it to the serious consideration of all spiritually minded,
impartial Friends, whether such a practice can be of any injury to Truth or Friends,
or lessen the ministry or the discipline of Truth,
which in a general way has been established in the churches of Christ.

In the year 1694, I sailed from Cork to Bristol,
and from there I went to the Yearly Meeting of London,
to which also came our worthy elder William Edmundson,
with several other Friends from Ireland.

To this meeting,
George Keith appealed against a judgment given forth concerning him in Pennsylvania,
and he brought with him two other very bitter-spirited men.
On the part of the Society came our worthy Friend Samuel Jennings,
with some others to vindicate their judgment.
The meeting held nine or ten days longer than usual;
and although Friends laboured with him exceedingly, yet it was all to no purpose,
for he was past recovery, and soon after set up a separate meeting at Turners`' Hall,
and wrote most maliciously against Friends.
Some time after he left that meeting, turned deacon of the Church of England,
as it is termed, and wrote many very bitter and wicked books against Friends and Truth.

'''

+++[+++Our Divine Lord and Master, when he sojourned outwardly among men,
assured his followers, "`If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch,
and is withered.`"
While he has ever shown himself abundantly willing and able
to save to the uttermost those that come unto him,
and has in every age proved himself to be a strong hold in the day of trouble,
and a very present help in every time of need,
delighting to manifest himself for the comfort and
strength of those who abide in Him the Vine;
so, on the other hand,
this awful alternative has been all along conspicuously fulfilled upon those,
who having once known the blessedness of being engrafted into the Truth,
have gone from it, and fallen away.
It was remarked by Robert Barclay, and it has been observed from that day to the present,
that few who leave our Society on account of the
way of the cross being too narrow for them,
ever turn out to be anyway eminent or truly estimable
among those to whom they may attach themselves.
Perhaps the case of George Keith,
who is above alluded to by his contemporary Joseph Pike,
is as strongly to this point as any other that could be named,
and therefore may be suitably held up to the notice of the Society and to others,
at this day, for our warning and instruction;
seeing that the most accomplished Christian has need
to watch and pray that he enter not into temptation,
and also to take heed lest there be in any way an evil heart
of unbelief in departing from the living God,
whose preserving presence and grace, duly heeded,
is sufficient for every possible exigency.

In regard to natural abilities,
as well as those acquirements which are so eagerly
and perseveringly aspired to at schools and colleges,
George Keith is said to have excelled;
and these were in good degree subjected and regulated,
as we have ample ground to believe, by the yoke of Christ.
Of this he gave evidence, both by doing and suffering, for a long course of years,
upon his joining the Society of Friends.
He was fully convinced of their principles, zealously advocated them by preaching,
by writing, and by public disputation,
and sealed his attachment to them by sharing with his brethren
the cruel persecutions and imprisonments they endured.
Might we not then have reasonably expected from such a one,
when he became dissatisfied with this religious profession, and joined what is termed,
"`The established Church of England,`" that he would
have done credit to the cause he had taken up?
Surely, he had much inducement, from motives that act strongly on most men,
by his whole future career to endeavour to convince both his former and his new friends,
that he had made a wise choice, that he had discovered a higher, purer,
and "`more excellent way,`" wherein also his gifts and talents should shine more advantageously.
But how opposite to this,
was the downward path of the once worthy and admired George Keith!

He had been beyond all question a man truly enlightened,
and deeply versed in the things that relate to the
kingdom of God,--"`once enlightened,`" when,
among the tribulated people called Quakers,
he was strengthened with might in the inner man to endure
hardness and to despise the shame of the cross of Christ;
with them he had been "`made partaker of the Holy Spirit,`" had
"`tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come.`"
But, leaning to his own understanding, his heart was weaned from,
and grew exalted above the lowly witness for God in the conscience,
so that he grew wise in his own conceit, impatient of rebuke or controul,
and thus the more easily fell into the subtle suggestions
and reasonings of the adversary of souls.

The contrast was great, certainly, between Keith and his frequent companion, Barclay,
as ever must be the case between those who hold fast their integrity,
"`the beginning of their confidence steadfast unto the end,`" and those who, like Keith,
have not kept their safe habitation in the light and truth of Christ,
but have become "`wandering stars`" from the firmament of God`'s power,
even "`unstable as water,`" so as at length to be
like unto the "`raging waves of the sea,
foaming out their own shame,`" whose troubled waters
"`cannot rest,`" but "`cast up mire and dirt.`"
These two individuals had similar advantages, were also liable to similar temptations:
they were yokefellows in religious experience and often in religious services,
insomuch that some, in their attempts to undervalue Barclay`'s labour of love,
have even attributed to Keith the arguments of Barclay,
as though the latter had merely borrowed and copied the sentiments of the former.
They had indeed oftentimes taken sweet counsel together,
and gone up in company as to the house of the Lord,
being baptized together by one Spirit into nearness, yes, oneness,
even by that Spirit which contrites and humbles, purities and sustains the soul.

But in Keith was the truth of that well known language fulfilled,
"`With the talents of an angel,
a man may be a fool;`" or as the apostle words it of some,
who "`professing themselves to be wise, became fools,`" and "`vain in their imaginations,
their foolish heart was darkened.`"
Accordingly, that very system of religious faith and practice,
which poor George Keith had loathed and rejected as corrupt,
against which he had borne so noble a testimony,
did he come to embrace and to swallow down with all its accompaniments;
admitting into his mind a most virulent enmity against the whole scope and tendency
of those views of Christian doctrine which he had unanswerably defended;
so that the Friends, in reply to his attacks upon them and their principles,
were readily able "`out of his own mouth`" to judge
him:--it was literally Keith against Keith.

Now this is precisely the situation and dilemma into which
some in connection with us are in danger of falling,
or have fallen, at the present juncture.
George Keith and his followers called themselves "`Christian
Quakers,`" as though the original Quakers were no Christians,
and they set up separate meetings.
He accused the Society at large of Deism and overthrowing Christianity,
because they set the Spirit above the Scriptures, saying,
"`that to hold that the Spirit was any lawgiver to
believers since the days of Christ and his apostles,
is of no less dangerous consequence than to overthrow
Christianity and introduce Deism,`" etc.

On his mind becoming imbued with disaffection towards Friends,
the first occasion he took against them in point of doctrine was this,
that they did not sufficiently preach Christ`'s outward or personal appearance,
sufferings, and death, etc.; indeed he represented,
that these important truths were actually permitted to go into oblivion,
were even dead and buried among the Quakers;
and that he was raised up to be an instrument in the hands of the Almighty,
by whom in a heavenly vision he had been expressly instructed
to revive and proclaim these ancient fundamental truths.
Well might Thomas Ellwood exclaim, "`Judge now,
what a conceited opinion this man has of himself,
and what evil thoughts he has let in concerning Friends, that he could let fly a slander,
which affects not only all our ministering Friends,
but even the body of Friends in general.`"
"`That suggestion,`" continues he, "`is as false as it is foul.
For these great and weighty doctrines not only always, since we were a people, have been,
but still are at this day owned, received, believed, confessed to,
and acknowledged by the body of Friends,
and declared and set forth in our public meetings in the openings of the Divine Life,
and in the movings, guidance, and direction of the Holy Spirit.`"

And John Whiting gives a similar testimony as follows:
"`For my part I will freely declare,
(having been conversant among the Quakers from my childhood,
and can remember longer ago than George Keith was a Quaker,
and have had intimate acquaintance with many of the
most eminent among them for many years,
and heard their declarations,
and read more of their books than ever George Keith saw perhaps,)
that I never heard or found that they did in the least slight or
undervalue Christ`'s coming and suffering in the flesh,
or the fruit and benefit of it in order to salvation;
but only that people had made the historical belief of the outward transactions
of it all their faith that they counted necessary to salvation,
and had neglected the inward work of it.
Therefore were they raised up of the Lord to turn people`'s
minds to the measure of Christ`'s Spirit in themselves,
that thereby they might come to know and partake of the benefit of it.`"

And Ellwood also makes a similar observation,
to this import:--That the apostasy in the early ages of the Christian
church was rather from the inward life and power of godliness,
than from an acknowledgement of the outward appearance and work of Christ in the flesh;
insomuch that while the latter doctrines continued from age to age to
be admitted and preached among every sect of professed Christians,
the doctrines relative to the manifestation of Christ by
his Spirit in the heart were generally departed from,
lost, and forgotten.
"`Therefore,`" continues he,
"`when it pleased God to raise up and send forth a true Gospel ministry again,
in this latter age of the world, to restore true Christianity,
and to gather out of the many professions a peculiar people to himself,
it was agreeable to the Divine Wisdom, to bring to light that which had been hidden,
to restore to the nations that which had been lost,
to turn people to that which they were most ignorant of, and strangers to,
rather than that which they professed to know before
and had been all along trained up in.`"

The sequel of George Keith`'s history need not be much enlarged on.
His adherents gradually forsook him,
perceiving that his religious tenets were fast verging
towards those of the "`Established Church of England.`"
At length, after having used his utmost endeavours to traduce and trouble Friends,
in a highly dishonourable and unworthy manner,
but professedly with a view to recover them from the error of their way;
as a reward for his services,
he was presented with the living of Elburton parish in Sussex, where he ended his days.
It seems, he was favoured near his latter end with seasons of serious reflection,
wherein he viewed the peaceful state of his mind,
while in unity and peace with the "`Quakers`" as brethren,
and felt remorse under the loss of it; on his deathbed using this language,
"`I wish I had died when I was a Quaker; for then, I am sure,
it would have been well with my soul!`"--See Jaffray`'s Diary, etc. p. 548, etc.

To show with what little success his exertions to pervert
what Friends believed to be the right way of the Lord,
and to subvert them from it, were attended, John Whiting writes to him that,
"`I am satisfied that your clamours have given occasion
to many to inquire after and peruse our books,
whereby they have seen your sandy foundation and deceit,
so that more have been convinced of the Truth we hold, since you began this quarrel,
(yes, what if I should say of the clerical part too,) than you have drawn off Quakers.`"
Whiting further quotes the just remark of a priest in the Established Church;
"`It is the best of our people who go over to the Quakers,
but it is the worst of the Quakers who come to us.`"
It seems clear beyond all dispute,
that Keith`'s course was one of willful opposition to conviction,
and thus the light he was favoured with rapidly became obscured, till it might be said,
How great was that darkness which enveloped his understanding!
Whiting dares him to deny, that he had confessed,
he felt more of God in the worst meeting that ever he was
in among the Quakers than the best in the Church of England!

A memorable observation of poor G. Keith, when he was united to Friends,
and wrote in defence of their principles, must not be withheld.
He affirms in one of his publications,
that he never met with any writer against the Quakers (and he had then been one
of their Society about twenty-seven years) who fairly stated their principles,
but miserably belied and abused them,
either by affirming things to be their principles which were not,
or by so unfairly representing and wresting their words by their addings and diminishings,
that they could not at all acknowledge them as such; which, he says,
is a manifest evidence of the weakness and badness of their cause,
and of that evil conscience that is in them.
And yet perhaps it may be as truly affirmed of this very person,
that no one adversary to the Society of Friends ever
abused their meaning much more than George Keith,
when he became an apostate from them.--Editor.]

From this year until 1702,
I attended the Half-year`'s Meetings and other services for Truth and Friends.

In 1694, my dearly beloved friend and companion, Samuel Randall, fell sick of a fever,
and was like to die, which brought me under very great exercise of mind,
and I mourned in spirit, and prayed to the Lord to spare his life.
My exercise and grief were so great, that I thought if he died,
I could freely have died with him, as the loss of him would have been as my right hand;
for he never flinched from the testimony of Truth, but always stood courageously for it,
and I steadfastly united with him therein,
for we were of one heart and mind in the service of Truth.
But the Lord was pleased to restore him, for which I felt truly thankful in heart.
In the time of his sickness,
he was exceedingly concerned in spirit for the prosperity
of Truth and the growth of Friends therein;
that all things might be kept in order, not only as to their inward conditions,
but outwardly as to conduct, apparel, and household furniture, etc.

In 1702, with our worthy Friend and elder, William Edmundson,
and about ten other Friends from Ireland, I attended the Yearly Meeting of London,
and joined in the service of Truth.
We met with some exercise in that meeting.

In 1703, I likewise attended that meeting, landing at Bristol.
I proceeded to Nailsworth, to meet our beloved elder, William Edmundson,
and back to Bristol, where he had good service for the Lord.
From there we went to London, where were many more Friends from Ireland.
At this meeting also, we had great exercise of spirit.
From this year to 1710, I continued to attend the Half-year`'s Meetings in Dublin,
also the parliament at times, and other services for Truth, and in the year 1709,
I wrote a treatise upon Baptism and the Supper, having been pressed in mind so to do.

From 1710 to 1715, I attended each Yearly Meeting in London,
at which meetings were several Friends from Ireland:
in all of them we met with great exercise of mind.

This was the last year I was able to attend the Yearly Meeting of London,
for lack of ability of body; yet from that time till 1717,
I ventured in the summer season to Dublin meeting; but the last time I was so very ill,
that my dear wife feared I would have died on the road;
since which I have not been able to travel, nor do I believe I ever shall,
having continued at home to this year, 1723.
I am now under great exercise of spirit, together with some other Friends,
on account of a loose, libertine spirit, which has got up,
particularly in some of our youth, who in a stiff spirit,
would introduce some things that the Spirit of Truth led us out of, and which, I know,
from most assured experience, was the Lord`'s doing.
So I, with other concerned Friends, have laboured exceedingly to stand in the gap,
and oppose that unruly spirit.
May the Lord, if it be His blessed will, interpose,
and bring it down by His mighty power, and humble them in mercy;
that so they may not stand in opposition,
which would lead to their own destruction forever.

In the Fourth month, 1718, died my dearly beloved friend and cousin, Samuel Randall,
with whom I continued in unity and brotherhood unto the end.
His decease was cause of great grief to his wife, family, and Friends,
for in him we lost a most zealous champion for Truth.
To me, in particular, he was a very helpful companion; and I may say,
the burden therein has been much greater and heavier since his departure,
feeling the lack of his help in the service of Truth;
though still with thankfulness I can also acknowledge,
that there are some others raised up, who stand faithful to the testimony;
and I pray the Lord to raise up many more.
Yet a day scarcely passes, without my thinking of him, and I feel my loss with sorrow.
I am satisfied he is gone to a better place, and is at rest with the Lord; and I desire,
that the few days I may yet have to spend, I may so live,
as that at the end of my time here, I may receive, as I doubt not he has received,
a crown of immortal glory!
Amen, says my soul.

+++[+++The reader is referred to the work called Piety Promoted, the sixth part,
for an account of this valued Friend,
and also to Rutty`'s History of Friends in Ireland, p. 261.
Some particulars respecting his father, Francis Randall,
have been kindly communicated to the Editor, which,
as they are not recorded (that he is aware of) in the above or other similar publications,
it is thought may be worthy of preservation.

Francis, son of Henry and Jane Randall of Lyndhurst, in Hampshire,
came to Ireland with the English army in 1649.
It is probable he joined the Society of Friends about 1655,
having laid down his military profession on the conclusion of the civil wars.
He settled at the Deeps of the Slaney, now Randall`'s Mills, near Enniscorthy,
in the county of Wexford.
He suffered much for his adherence to what he believed was required of him.
In 1660, being in a meeting held at the house of James Becket, in New Ross,
he was led out by a guard of soldiers, who treated him shamefully,
and thrust him out of the town, by direction of Lieut.
Col. Jones, who bid his men do anything they pleased to the Quakers,
they being "`worse than dogs.`"
In 1662, for not paying money for "`christening`" his children,
and absenting himself from the public worship, he was excommunicated,
and upon a writ "`__excom. cap.__`" he was imprisoned in the jail of Wexford for above two years.
Again, in 1670, he, with other Friends, were taken from their religious meeting,
and detained in prison, till released by an order from the government.

In 1690, king James, when flying in distress after the battle of the Boyne,
and almost without attendants,
not knowing on whom to depend for assistance to reach Duncannon Fort,
near to which a French ship of war waited to convey him to France,
recollecting that Francis Randall had often visited his camp to
obtain the restoration of horses for himself and his friends,
and the king believing he could depend on his fidelity,
determined to trust his person in his hands,
and accordingly proceeded from Enniscorthy to his house.
But being observed by a party of men employed by F. R. in fitting out a small vessel,
they proposed seizing on him, to obtain a large reward; when F. R. interposed,
and would not allow the least interference with his guest.
On taking him into his house,
observing the danger the king was in from the pistols in his belt being cocked,
he took them, and adjusting them, remarked the risk to the dejected monarch, who replied,
that he had not noticed it.
After getting some refreshment,
F+++.+++ R. sent his son with fresh horses to escort him to the Fort,
which he reached in safety.
The king left a token of his gratitude for F. R.`'s hospitality, and Christian kindness,
which is still in possession of his descendants.
The Monthly Meeting for the county of Wexford have left this testimony respecting him.

[.embedded-content-document.testimony]
--

Francis Randall departed this life the 8th of Fifth month,
1692,--a man who was dearly loved, being a serviceable man among us in church government.
He was a strength to the weak, and a help to them that were feeble,
a man for Truth as well as of courage,
who could express himself in Truth`'s concerns beyond many.
The loss of him is a loss to the church of Christ where he lived,
and the lively remembrance of him cannot be forgotten by them,
being of an exemplary life and conduct,
his testimony clear and sound and firm in the Truth,
undaunted in the asserting of it.--Editor.]

Not being now able to travel as formerly,
I have continued at home under deep exercise and travail of soul, at times,
for the prosperity of Zion; and that a stop might be put to that floating spirit,
which has of late years arisen among some of our young people,
and an easy and covetous spirit in some who are older, who once knew better things.
Under this exercise,
I was pressed in spirit to write an epistle to our Half-year`'s Meeting,
though I confess I was reluctant to give up to it,
until Friends were gone to attend the service of that meeting,
which occasions the apology I make in the beginning of it.
The epistle is as follows.

[.embedded-content-document.epistle]
--

[.salutation]
My dearly beloved friends and brethren:

It has several times, livingly sprung in my mind,
but more especially since our Friends of this city went to your meeting,
to visit you with an epistle; since I am not able, through weakness, to do it in body,
as I heretofore used to do.
But I confess I could not presently give up to it,
not knowing how my presuming to write to a Half-year`'s
Meeting might be looked upon by some.
This indeed had almost prevailed on me to forbear,
but finding I could not be easy with forbearing, I gave up to it.

I do, in the first place,
send you the salutation of my most endeared love in our Lord Jesus Christ;
and particularly unto you, my beloved brethren,
who have kept your habitations in the Lord`'s holy and eternal Truth,
and have retained your zeal and integrity for his holy name.
You are near and dear unto me, in the covenant of Light and Life.
You are as bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh, in a spiritual sense;
and unto you it is, that my love and life flow at this time; which love,
distance of place cannot separate or wear out.
Surely our love to Truth and for Truth`'s sake, does not decay or wax old,
as does a garment; for though our outward man may wax old, decay,
and grow weaker and weaker,
yet those who retain their first love and integrity to the Lord,
their love to one another, and their zeal for the Lord`'s holy name and Truth,
increase and grow stronger and stronger.
Truth is of a growing nature,
and of the increase of Christ`'s government in the souls of the faithful there is no end,
until time ends them here.

Let us therefore my beloved Friends, stand fast in that love and liberty,
with which our Lord has joined us together, and made us free; first,
taking heed to ourselves, and next, using our utmost endeavours in the Truth,
that none may be again entangled with the yoke of bondage,
especially such as have begun well and run well for a season.
Oh! says my soul, that none of these may ever grow cold, lukewarm,
or indifferent in their zeal and concern for the Lord`'s holy name and Truth.
For surely, I believe there never was more need than now,
for the faithful elders to stir up and encourage
one another to zeal and faithfulness to the Lord,
against all those things which visibly appear, and endeavour to invade the camp of God;
and more particularly, a spirit of covetousness and love of the world on one hand,
and a spirit of height, pride and liberty on the other.

These things I am sensible have prevailed with many,
who yet would be accounted of the number of the spiritual Israel of God;
and where any of those things appear, whether in elder or younger,
I testify for the Lord, that they are not of the Father, but are of this world.

And therefore it is in my heart to say unto you, my beloved brethren--not as a director,
or one that dictates to you, who know it as well as I do,
but in the love of God and zeal for his holy name, and in much brotherly love,
to the stirring up of our pure minds by way of remembrance,--let all the faithful elders,
and the youth too, in whose hearts the zeal of the Lord burns against these things,
join hand in hand, and put shoulder to shoulder as one man,
and endeavour in every quarter to put a stop to the growing of these things.

Be valiant for the Lord and his Truth; bear your testimonies against them;
stand in the gap, and endeavour to make up the breach that the enemy has made.
And although the stouthearted would make you the butt and mark of their envy,
be not discouraged, it is no new thing, it was so of old as well as in our day;
remember your rewarder is the Holy One of Israel.
As Truth knows no partiality, so it will lead us not to spare any guilty elders,
no more than the younger--let the Lord`'s line of justice
and judgment be stretched over the old as well as the young.

Nor will what I here say touch the faithful--no. But if indeed any unfaithful
elders give evil examples to the leading of the flock astray,
such are worthy of double blame;
as their condemnation will be double in the day of the Lord.

Stand up therefore my beloved brethren,
in the zeal of the Lord and in the authority of his holy Truth, over all iniquity;
thresh the mount of Esau, yet not in an angry spirit, in the man`'s part,
but in the zeal of the Lord, which is attended with knowledge and a good understanding,
though sometimes with sharpness too.
It is only in this zeal, which proceeds from the Spirit of Truth,
that any of us can do acceptable service for the Lord.

My dear Friends, I may here let you know, that my soul has greatly mourned,
and been sorely afflicted of late, even day and night at times,
under a sense of the growing of the evils I have above mentioned,
and I believe it has been so with many of you too.
Are there any guilty elders, who heretofore were very zealous for the Lord,
and the holy discipline of Truth, that are now cold and indifferent,
and who see the growing of these things with an easy mind?
I pray the Lord it may not be so: but if it should be so with any,
I shall from there conclude, that the spirit and love of this world,
or some objects therein, have prevailed upon them, instead of their growing in the Truth.
Oh! my soul laments the case of these, not only for their own sakes,
but also for the evil consequences that attend it,
in their being bad examples to the flock of God; and let each know,
that very heavy will their account be in the day of the Lord,
unless they speedily repent and do their first works.

And you well know, my dear Friends, without my telling it,
how it was with us in the beginning, when the Lord, by his mighty power,
broke in upon our spirits, in the day of our first espousals to the Lord.
Oh! the brokenness of heart! the tenderness of our spirits in that day!
The melting of the love of God, and the self-denial that did attend us in that day!
The living sense thereof, is at this time renewed upon my soul, by the holy remembrancer,
with humble thanksgiving and praise to the holy name of the Lord,
and even with my very mouth as in the dust before Him.
Then, oh! then it was,
that the glory and greatness of this world were stained in our eyes;
we loved the Lord above all;
and the honour and prosperity of his holy Truth were
nearer and dearer to us than the whole world,
no, than life itself.
Then we could do nothing against the Truth, but all the little we could for it,
and then we were easily entreated to everything that made for Truth,
and the honour of it.

Now as Truth changes not, but is the same today and forever,
so let everyone who has known their beginning to be thus, who yet have come to a loss,
though perhaps they are not so sensible of it as they should be,
let them I say try and examine themselves by the light of Truth;
and let this be the test and trial to such,--that
as Truth is of a growing and increasing nature,
so if they have grown in the Truth, they will find an increase of love, tenderness, zeal,
and concern for the honour and prosperity of Truth,--then, all is well.
But if instead of this, they find coldness and indifferency of spirit,
and others whose eyes are single to the Lord do see
that they have let in a worldly spirit;
that they love the things of the world and the covetousness thereof, more than Truth;
and while they can grasp, heap up, and hold fast the stuff of this world,
though perhaps at the same time,
the Lord`'s holy truth and the honour of it suffer by their means,
they can be easy without regard to the prosperity of Truth; I say,
if this be the case of any elders or leaders of the people; let their fair speeches,
their plausible pretences or arguments be ever so strong and great, it is as plain to me,
as the sun shining at noon-day, that such have come to a great loss,
and have need to repent and do their first works.

Oh! this spirit of covetousness, where it prevails, darkens and clouds the understanding,
and eats out all that is good.
The zeal of the Lord burns in my soul against it;
and I believe there are few greater evils in the sight of the Lord than this,
though there are few evils that have more cloaks and coverings than this has.^
footnote:[See note at the end of this epistle.]

For where is the man that has the marks of covetousness, ever so plain upon him,
who will confess he is a covetous man?
yet it is very plain to those, whose eyes are single to the Lord,
that there are too many such, though they will not confess it.
It was, we find, a great temptation in the days of old,
and therefore our blessed Lord bid them take heed and beware of covetousness.
His holy apostles told the believers, it was idolatry;
the love of money was the root of all evil;
and that covetousness ought not to be so much as named among them,
with many such like expressions in Scripture; all which show,
that it was a most abominable evil in the sight of the Lord then, and it is the same now.

Dear Friends, I confess I have dwelt long, and have been very large upon this subject,
and yet I well know that many of you need not this advice, nor is it intended for you:
place it therefore, I beseech you, to the zeal and concern that rests upon my spirit,
that wherever it appears it may be stood against, threshed down,
and judgment placed upon it, because it is for judgment.
I can in sincerity say, it is the interest, honour,
and prosperity of Truth that I aim at, and which I have at heart,--and yet I am nothing.
I am mean, weak, and feeble, as liable to temptation as the very weakest;
but all our strength and ability to withstand temptation are of and from the Lord alone;
and our part is, as our Lord advised his disciples, to watch and pray continually,
lest we fall into temptation.

As to what I have hinted relating to a high, proud, libertine spirit,
that has also prevailed upon too many, especially our youth.
We have you know minutes enough against such things;
but the main point is putting them in due execution; and first,
that those who are concerned to advise others,
should themselves be good examples to the flock of God in all things;
for those whom they have to deal with, are quick-sighted enough,
and if they see a spirit of covetousness, or other things disagreeable to Truth,
prevailing upon such elders, how can the advice of such reach?
But rather they will slight, disdain, or at least disregard their advice,
and harden themselves in such things, as being less evils,
if they count them evils at all, than covetousness, etc.

I could enlarge abundantly, my mind being full of matter,
but I conclude with humble prayers to the God of all our mercies, that he will attend,
and be with you by His divine presence as heretofore.

And remain your friend and brother in the holy Truth,

--

This epistle was read in the Half-year`'s Meeting, and well approved,
and entered in their meeting-book, that Friends had good unity therewith,
and that it should be recorded among the epistles,
and directed copies to be sent to each Province meeting,
and from there to every monthly and particular meeting, and to be read,
not only in the men`'s and women`'s meetings, but to others also,
as they might see occasion.

+++[+++The Editor can scarcely forbear very briefly confirming the tenour
of the foregoing epistle in relation to the sin of covetousness,
which is by the apostle Paul defined to be idolatry, Col. 3:5,
and which he excludes with more infamous evils from the kingdom of heaven, 1 Cor. 6:10.
It was the remarkable testimony of an eminent elder in the Truth,
"`Not all the persecutions, not all the apostates,
nor all the open or private enemies we have ever had,
have done us as a Christian Society the damage that riches have done.`"
And the justness of this observation has been in succeeding times
most abundantly verified and illustrated on every hand,
in the desolation that has generally followed the
inordinate pursuit of riches and worldly greatness,
both to the victims of this snare and to their posterity.

Where the spirit of genuine Christianity has full place in the heart,
it will assuredly evince itself, as it has always done,
by that heavenly-mindedness which inclines us not
unduly to look every man on his own things,
rather on the other hand scarcely to consider the things that we possess as our own,
but as held in trust for the glory of the great Giver of every good and perfect gift,
and as entirely at his disposal.
This was the blessed state of the early Christians,
and accordingly we find it recorded of them in Cave`'s Primitive Christianity,
that they were not concerned for more of this world`'s good than
what would supply the necessities of nature and the needs of others.
And again, of the disciples of Wicklif we read,
that they considered they had their cross to bear in trade,
not less than in the profession of the faith; that they mixed little with the busy world,
that they maintained themselves wholly by their own labour, and utterly despised wealth,
being fully content with bare necessaries.
In a similar manner did our early Friends also,
in an eminent degree and to a great extent,
let their "`moderation be known unto all men,`" as might be largely shown,
and indeed has been already somewhat manifested,
and will further appear in the course of this journal.--Editor.]
