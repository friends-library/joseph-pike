[short="Preliminary Observations"]
== Preliminary Observations, Chiefly Addressed to the Society of Friends.

The two narratives^
footnote:[The journals of Joseph Pike and Joseph Oxley were
originally published by John Barclay in a single volume.
These documents have now been separated and are available
independently on www.friendslibrary.com]
now offered to the notice of the Society of Friends and others,
are not made choice of for publication on the present occasion,
as containing anything of very extraordinary or novel character;
they may not be calculated to impart that sort of attractive and peculiar interest,
which the diary of a Jaffray or the life of a Dewsbury must do,
to minds capable of a true relish for spiritual things;
but they nevertheless furnish much that is wholesome and unsophisticated.
If the discipline of the heart to the Author of our lives,
if the discipline of the church to her Holy Head,
"`who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity,`" be of value,
then the experience of his servants,
of those who were concerned to "`walk with God,`" and to "`put on the Lord Jesus Christ,`"
cannot be devoid of some important bearing upon the state of every reader.

In the first of these journals, that of Joseph Pike, will be found,
besides the incidents of his life,
a lively and instructive exemplification of that kind of care and labour,
by example and by exhortation,
which the early Friends most undeniably and conspicuously bestowed,
upon the vineyard of their own hearts and towards each other in the Lord.
The whole drift of his exercise is, that both he himself,
and all those professing with him to have "`received Christ Jesus,`" should "`walk
in him,`" should "`adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things,`" should
"`show by a good conduct their works with meekness of wisdom,`" should "`be holy
in all of their conduct,`" should have their "`fruit unto holiness,`" in short,
should altogether illustrate the "`pure and undefiled religion.`"

Now, in this point of view,
the counsel that is handed by this worthy elder to his successors,
to those who would rightly belong to and build up the church of Christ,
who would truly "`comfort all her waste places,`" is of peculiar and pressing import.
Here are sound, well-seasoned materials; plain, positive, practical advices,
not showy and superficial, but sober and solid admonitions,
grounded upon and growing out of Scriptural truth,
the result of conviction and of experience, highly needful to be borne in mind,
laid to heart, day by day acted upon as we pass through life,
and which involve much of genuine self-denial, and strait-keeping of the soul.
Nothing is to be found of a wild, doubtful, crude, or strange enthusiasm,
no morbid refinement, no fine-spun empty theories,
no mere "`talk of the lips,`" which the wise man tells us,
"`tends only to poverty,`" no beautiful symmetry and paint of language without life,
nor dry doctrinals separated from and set at variance with that transforming power,
in which alone true doctrine can be truly held, or availingly held forth.
It is as if the writer all along conveyed to us the very substance of the adage,
"`Tell me not how any talk,
but how they walk;`" agreeably to that language of the dear Redeemer,
"`He that has my commandments, and keeps them,
he it is that loves me:`" "`He that follows me, shall not walk in darkness,
but shall have the light of life:`" "`If any man will come after me,
let him deny himself, take up his cross daily,
and follow me:`" "`Not everyone that says unto me, Lord, Lord,
shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father,
which is in heaven.`"
For, assuredly, as said his beloved disciple, "`He that keeps Christ`'s commandments,
dwells in him, and he in him.`"

It is lamentable to think, how much is lost by professing Christians,
and how much is gained by the enemy of souls,
when they allow themselves to be "`carried about by various and strange
doctrines,`" or at least unduly detained amidst fields of speculation,
and "`striving about words to no profit,
but to the subverting of the hearers,`" of the readers, and of the speakers also.
Indeed, even "`good doctrine,`" "`sound doctrine,`" essential doctrine,
that which is "`according to godliness,`" as it can only be given
forth under the express direction of our ever-living Oracle,
High Priest, and Holy Head, the Minister of the sanctuary,
so must it be received in entire subjection,
with full resignation to his good will and pleasure,
who condescends to work mightily and effectually
in those that believe,--yet oftentimes obscurely,
and to man`'s judgment weakly, yes, foolishly.
In spiritual, as in temporal things, "`a little that a righteous man has,
is better than the riches of many wicked;`" for, in this respect, it is most true,
that "`the blessing of the Lord`" is that which "`makes rich.`"
So, a little shedding forth of light and of truth from Him,
whose doctrine drops as the rain, and distils as the dew, "`who opens,
and none can shut,`" and who delights to satisfy the longing soul,
and to fill the hungry soul with goodness,
when received into ground rightly prepared to appropriate it,
"`into an honest and good heart,`" has a most strengthening efficacy there,
to the building up of such believers in their most holy faith.

It was a heinous sin in Israel of old,
that they slighted or loathed the manna which the Lord had provided for them; and one,
on the other hand, reverently prays, "`Feed me with food convenient for me.`"
Surely, as his reasonable creatures, his redeemed people, even these who wait upon Him,
he will "`give them their food in due season;`" for he feeds
his flock and causes them to lie down in green pastures,
and cannot fail to "`bless the provision of Zion.`"
But, now as ever, the rich and the full are sent empty away from the banquet of our King;
indeed, these come prepared only to loathe the honeycomb: and,
whatever may be their dreams of satisfaction and comfort in the use of means,
who are contriving and choosing for themselves,
who would cater and carve according to their own apprehensions in religious matters,
such, when really awakened to see themselves as they are and where they are,
will ever find leanness and emptiness the portion
of the immortal part,--they inherit the wind,
they shall be even "`filled with their own devices.`"
How sickly, how superficial,
how unstable is their state! tossed about by every wind of doctrine,
readily "`beguiled with enticing words,`" with great swelling words,
the words which man`'s wisdom teaches, and which the itching ear stretches forth after;
but the truth, the pearl of great price, is almost thrown away upon them,
as upon the swine, they receive it only to abuse, to misapprehend, to pervert it.

The Christian path is a plain path,--blessed be his name who is the Captain of salvation,
the Leader and Commander of his spiritual Israel;
he has opened and cast up the way for them; through his obedience unto suffering,
unto death, he has consecrated it by his own example,
and has graciously offered to guide us by his spirit into all truth.
It was his own declaration, "`If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself;`" that is,
he shall have adequate evidence of my doctrine; and again, he declared,
"`My sheep hear my voice,`" "`and I am known of mine.`"
These were, however, to become as little children,
to receive the kingdom of God as a little child, as new-born babes; for unto such,
these things were to be revealed, but not to any others.
Our Wonderful Counsellor did not even clear up his
divine truth to the understandings of his disciples,
further than he saw needful for their present growth,
further than they were able to receive and to bear it, Mark 4:33,
and John 16:12. And though his apostle Paul wrote some
things "`hard to be understood,`" yet himself testifies,
that he had fed his hearers "`with milk,
and not with solid food,`" because they were not able as yet to bear it.
Our Lord accepted, and he still accepts, the meek and contrite spirit,
the soul that is simply made willing to come unto him, to learn of him,
and to obey him:--his anointing teaches them "`of all things.`"

Undoubtedly, there are times, corrupt and unstable times,
when the precious privileges and hopes of the Gospel
are more than usually called in question,
when everyone that has bought the truth, according to his measure and station,
according also to the circumstances in which he may be placed,
is more especially called upon to stand fast in the faith,
to hold fast that they have received, and even, as occasion calls,
"`earnestly to contend for`" this faith which was
"`once,`" and is yet "`delivered to the saints.`"
The early Christians were quickly introduced to the duty
of giving a reason for the hope that was in them;
it was their lot to be "`disputing daily,`" and reasoning much,
not only with open gainsayers, but with feigned friends,
with false brethren and false teachers,
with such as were "`of their own selves,`" who had either
"`crept in unawares`" to a profession of Christianity,
or had gone out from that they once had possession of;
these having "`turned from the holy commandment delivered unto
them,`" sought privily to bring in various forms of damnable heresy,
speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them,
according to the strong delusions under which Satan had bound them.

But did the primitive believers,
and such of them especially who were in some sort "`stewards of
the mysteries of God,`" tamely and blindly yield to such deceivers?
Though they followed peace with all men, and pursued it, did they at all compromise,
or by any means surrender,
any portion of that which was committed to them to keep unalloyed and inviolate?
Does not the apostle Paul declare to us his own line of conduct and that of his fellow-labours,
with the ground of it, in these forcible words?--"`To whom we gave place by subjection,
no, not for an hour; that the truth of the Gospel might continue with you.`"
And did he not, on that occasion, even hazard his own character in the eyes of others,
by seeming to incur the imputation of rash and contumacious procedure,
when he withstood Peter to the face,
and that before those who with him seemed to be pillars in the church,
rather than countenance or crouch to palpable dissembling and lack of uprightness?
In such a case,
did Paul act in a manner at all inconsistent with his own counsel to Timothy,
where he writes, "`The servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men,
apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves:
if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth?`"
Those who can discriminate, will surely say, he did not.

In like manner, in our day,
both among the first who went under the denomination
of "`Quakers,`" as in more recent times,
occasions have arisen again and again for religious controversy, wherein silence,
however desirable, would have been blameable.
Very much the same line of warfare, of explanation, of defence, and of rejoinder,
has been repeatedly called forth.
Sometimes, indeed, the necessity has been urgent, as in ancient periods of the church,
when many have been "`the unruly,
vain talkers and deceivers,`" "`who subvert whole houses,
teaching things which they ought not,`" that the mouths of such should be stopped;
and then, in the government of the church, the advice to Titus seems requisite,
to "`rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith.`"

Many have been the honourable champions raised up, qualified,
and also preserved in this description of arduous service,
who had to wrestle "`against principalities, against powers,
against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
against spiritual wickedness in high places.`"
These were doubtless adequately accoutred by "`the Captain
of the Lord`'s host`" with the whole armour of God;
"`the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,`"
whereby they were enabled to withstand in the evil day,
to quench in good degree the fiery darts of the wicked, to clear the truth,
to convince many gainsayers, and to be themselves clear of the blood of all men,
having not spared nor shrunk from plain dealing and faithful warning.
They strove lawfully, they kept the faith and their habitations in the truth,
also their ranks in righteousness, being evidently blessed and owned in their deeds,
according to their measure.

With these, the main purpose and proper object of controversy was never lost sight of,
amidst all needful, intricate and close argumentation.
They gave not heed to those things "`which minister questions rather than godly edifying,`"
they turned not aside "`unto vain jangling,`" when they charged and urged upon some,
that they should "`teach no other doctrine`" whatever,
than that which had been received by the church from the beginning.
They laboured to disabuse the beclouded judgment, to disentangle the soul;
to bring to that which puts an end to the very ground of all difference,
gives right discernment in spiritual things, will not amalgamate with error or evil,
but "`leads into`" and preserves in "`all truth,`" even in its purity,
in its peaceableness, in its oneness; as well in the comely form,
as in the life of godliness.
If they wounded, as they assuredly did and must,
mark what they touched,--it was the corrupt, the crooked, the fallen nature,
that which is for judgment, yes, for death, and must be slain, if, indeed,
the creature be delivered from its bondage.

It is no marvel, if, in general,
comparatively little success should attend such painful labour,
especially towards the parties more immediately concerned;
the prejudices of these are quickly enlisted, their religious credit is at stake,
their system is attacked,
their "`craft is in danger:`" yet this is no disparagement to the vocation
of one rightly engaged in earnestly contending for the faith,
and should be to him no source of undue discouragement.^
footnote:[That William Penn should have recommended his friend, Joseph Pike,
to read controversy sometimes, does not surprise the editor; for he is free to confess,
that, with reference to his own early religious progress,
when of all periods perhaps he was in the most tender and desirable state of mind,
the perusal occasionally of the controversial publications of Friends had a most strengthening,
deepening, and edifying effect upon him, of which he feels the value to this day.
And persuaded he is, that if more of his fellow-professors would candidly, deliberately,
and in a humble teachable frame consult such substantial
defences and illustrations of our faith,
which often have the consent of fathers, councils, martyrs, confessors,
and reformers of all ages and persuasions,
they might some of them become sounder advocates in the cause of truth,
and all would be in less danger of leaning to their own judgment,
or being caught by the flimsy interpretations of later time put upon holy Scripture.]
The church is materially indebted to such labourers;
they claim the especial sympathy and succour of those that in some
sense "`stay by the stuff,`" or have not to sail in troubled waters.
It is an easy matter to judge and to find fault with them: undoubtedly,
their work and "`line of things`" may be somewhat
uncongenial to those preciously meek and quiet spirits,
who have little occasion to argue matters;
but if they love so dearly the "`peaceable habitations,`"
the "`quiet resting-places`" of Zion,
let them duly estimate the self-denial and the zeal of those
who are made willing to forego their own personal ease,
and who dare not shrink from standing as in the breach,
and are made as a mark to be shot at by every archer.--"`There
are diversities of gifts;`" and,
we read, that one has a gift after this manner, and another after that;
not any are to be slighted or despised, but to be occupied in the fear of the Lord,
and all the truly gifted are to be owned and honoured in their apportioned places.

"`A wholesome tongue is,`" indeed,
"`a tree of life,`" bringing forth its precious fruit in its proper season,
and after its own kind, and adapted for certain purposes,
but always "`good to the use of edifying,`" if not so evidently to one state, then,
it may be, to another.
But, on the opposite hand, "`Behold,
how great a matter,`" even "`a world of iniquity,`" is kindled
by a little unholy fire of an unruly tongue or pen,
especially when engaged about religious subjects.
David in his psalm complains of the "`mighty man`" who boasted himself in mischief,
who loved evil more than good, and lying rather than truth speaking:
"`You love all-devouring words,
O you deceitful tongue!`" "`your tongue devises mischiefs like a sharp razor working
deceitfully;`" and the issue of such doings the holy psalmist goes on to show,
and the end of such "`deceitful workers,`" who can
transform themselves "`as the ministers of righteousness.`"
The words of these may be "`smoother than butter,`" and "`softer than
oil,`" yet are they "`as drawn swords,`" and "`war is in the heart:`"
but their tongues will the Lord assuredly divide and destroy now,
as ever he has done in the generations of old.

"`Who is a wise man,`" said the apostle James, "`and endued with knowledge among you?
Let him show by a good conduct his works with meekness of wisdom.`"
For, continues he, "`If any man among you seem to be religious,
and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man`'s religion is vain.`"

It must be acknowledged, there are too many,
who are "`ever learning,`" and seem "`never able to come to the`"
saving "`knowledge of the truth,`" or to an establishment therein;
these are of the "`wavering`" and "`double-minded,`" of the "`double-tongued`" too,
who have little occasion to "`think`" that they shall "`receive anything of the Lord;`"
they are "`forgetful hearers,`" loving to listen to the songs of the prophets,
to the beautiful exhibitions and declarations of divine truth;
they can most freely canvass or criticise,
can readily define doctrinals to a hair`'s breadth, but then they go their way,
forgetting what manner of persons they have seen themselves to be,
or what manner of persons they have seen they ought to be "`in all holy conduct
and godliness;`" they are not "`doers of the work,`" nor continue in that "`law
of liberty,`" "`the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus,
which alone can set free from the law of sin and death.`"

Very congenial with the tenour of these observations,
are the remarks of a dignified advocate in the Gospel-cause, Samuel Fothergill,
respecting the times in which he lived:
"`There is a spirit that is gone forth into the camp, and is splendidly delusive;
it delights in good words, and feeds upon them; it cries out,
Help! help! but principally to the servants, not to the Master:
this spirit leads into notions: it snuffs up the wind,
and lives in commotions itself raises: all that are led by it are superficial,
and know nothing, and must lie down in sorrow.`"--[.book-title]#Letters of Friends,#
by John Kendall, 1802, vol. i. p. 22.
Another Friend, a discriminating and wise elder, writes thus to the same point:
"`The religion of some seems to consist in a remembrance of former experience,
a rational understanding of our principles, and the discipline of the church,
a personal communication with several of the foremost rank,
and some faculty for speaking and writing on religious subjects; when, in the mean time,
for lack of looking and living at home, for lack of watching unto prayer,
and waiting for renewed ability to offer the daily sacrifice on the fresh raised altar,
insensibility and incapacity gather strength,
and leanness enters into our souls.`"--Richard Shackleton.

To speak more generally,--There has been a great mass of high-sounding theology afloat,
a great flood of instrumental means altogether, and much too,
that all true Christians have occasion to rejoice in and be thankful for,
without doubt,--yet much more, that has had a weakening, a scattering,
and wide-wasting influence upon the churches of professing Christendom.
Whatever be the counteracting or modifying agencies at work,
especially the lively condition and pious dedication of heart prevalent in some directions,
the very systems of most denominations must ever tend this way,
while in relation to religious services congregations meet as they do,
and are provided for as they are.
But the unscriptural thirst for eloquent orations,
and what is called evangelical preaching,
has even reached those who "`have not so learned
Christ,`" that is,--as the apostle to the Ephesians,
long after the ascension of our Lord, explains it,--"`if so be that you have heard him,
and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus;`" so that the faith
even of these is and has been in imminent danger of being found standing
"`in the wisdom of men,`" rather than "`in the power of God.`"
For, if these receive the word,
rather as "`of man and by man,`" than as it is in truth "`the word of God,`"
the very same which "`effectually works in`" those "`that believe,`" then the
simple intrinsic message of divine love is apt to be overlooked by them and rejected,
or made of none effect; more especially when it is conveyed through the foolish things,
the weak things, the base things, the things that are not,
or in words which man`'s wisdom does not dictate.

Thus it comes to pass, that men`'s systems and men`'s persons are had in admiration,
and their natural and acquired powers are set up; some are puffed up for one,
and some against another, till their language unequivocally becomes, "`I am of Paul,
and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.`"--Verily, Christ is not divided,
nor his doctrine, nor his church; but he is "`the same yesterday, today, and forever!`"
O the inseparable harmony and completeness of all the parts of "`the doctrine of Christ!`"
There is no one can unequally hold, wresting out of its place,
any portion of essential truth, any attribute or office of our divine Saviour,
or can think more highly than he ought to think of any member of his body,
without incurring the awful liability of doing injury to Him, the holy Head thereof,
and endangering their own standing and connection with him.
"`How can you believe, which receive honour one of another?`"
said our blessed Lord himself.
And again "`This people draws near unto me with their mouth,
and honours me with their lips,`" with their nice distinctions,
with their orthodox systems,
with their very full verbal acknowledgments and literal
compliances,--"`but their hearts are far from me.`"
Verily, "`he that has the Son,
has life,`" he who rightly "`believes that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God:
and everyone that loves Him that begat,
loves him also that is begotten of Him;`" and he who rightly
"`shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God,
God dwells in him, and he in God.`"

But to return to the subject more immediately the occasion of these Preliminary Observations,
and from which the editor has freely digressed,
while speaking of the character of the succeeding journals,
and of the simplicity and plainness of the religion of our
blessed Redeemer.--If he does not greatly mistake,
both these worthy authors, Joseph Pike and Joseph Oxley, the former as an honoured elder,
the latter as an acceptable minister among Friends,
however differing in several respects from each other,
were alike remarkable for being "`clothed with humility,`" even "`the ornament of a
meek and quiet spirit,`" which is of greater price than more glaring accomplishments:
they were men of unusually diffident, unassuming,
and in a certain sense unprofessing stamp; they had no life in mere words;
though willing, when called upon, to witness a good confession, they were not forward,
but rather shrunk from, or at least placed no great stress upon,
large recitals and specific avowals of their faith,
preferring that the tenour of their lives and labours should bespeak whom they honoured,
and whom they delighted in serving.

It was certainly a valuable acknowledgment, and one which Friends have always acted on,
but worthy the special acceptation of every admirer of Baxter,
that in the latter period of his life,
when taking a matured review of his religious experience,
he should have thus expressed himself:--"`I less admire gifts of utterance,
and the bare profession of religion than I once did; and have much more love for many,
who by the lack of gifts do make an obscurer profession.
I once thought that almost all who could pray movingly and fluently,
and talk well of religion, had been saints.
But experience has opened to me, what odious crimes may consist with high profession.
While I have met with various obscure persons,
not noted for any extraordinary profession or forwardness in religion,
but only to live a quiet blameless life, whom I have after found to have long lived,
as far as I could discern, a truly godly and sanctified life.`"

This was indeed a marked feature in the calling of our Society,
that they were jealous of profession being beyond possession.
The circumstances of the times, in the course of their history,
have greatly fluctuated at different periods,
calling forth as was always the case in the annals of the church of Christ,
very varied and apparently opposite qualifications in the faithful;
yet these have never been actually at variance with each other,
or inconsistent in themselves with what the truth prescribes.
On the first origin of Friends as a distinct people,
the times were peculiarly corrupt and unsound,
all the elements as in a ferment of unsettlement,
religious truth and a holy zeal for it became mightily roused up and put in motion,
as it were,
to extricate herself from the chaos or sea of confusion in which she was enveloped.
When things subsided into more clearness, order, and quietness,
men`'s spirits became chastened or subdued,
some by that which can alone rightly restrain and regulate,
others lulled into forms and self-security;
and very different qualifications were thereupon elicited.
Undoubtedly, with many, the true zeal and valour abated; but where this was not the case,
and individuals retained in full their first love,
their devotedness to God and his cause,
these graces in the same individuals would not be
evinced in precisely the same way as heretofore,
but would appear of a softer, milder hue.
And not only so,
but a different class and kind of instruments would be needed in the church,
and would accordingly be raised up.

Not attending to this most natural and material distinction,
the early Friends have been rashly judged for over-zeal,
and those who succeeded them have been set down as cool moralists and mere worldlings.
There were, indeed, some that walked among the former,
whose tendency was even to Ranterism,
who "`went out into imaginations,`" or were in danger of being "`exalted
above measure;`" but the body of the faithful saw these outgoings,
and testified against them,
even in such as were highly gifted or had been near and dear to them.
There were those too among the modern Friends,
as there have always been in a greater or less degree, who were dry, and flat,
and lukewarm formalists,
even among the professed ministers of the Gospel,--some living on their own self-righteousness,
and some on the labours of their friends,
who by no means worked out their soul`'s salvation with fear and trembling.
Nevertheless, the truly living, exercised members were always deeply sensible of this:
and when, at times and in some places, oppressed with so lamentable a state of things,
at the lowest ebb, they were still preserved and strengthened also,
to stand against this deadly influence.
Going heavily on their way, suffering with the suffering seed,
they still upheld the pure, high standard of the Gospel, however obscurely,
however feebly, being truly enabled to worship God in the spirit,
to rejoice in Christ Jesus, and could have no confidence in the flesh.

It was probably this fear of exceeding what was committed to them,
or of laying greater stress on their testimony than the
modest view they took of their own standing warranted,
that, in years which are now gone by, in the days of Joseph Oxley and afterwards,
led some to be exceedingly cautious of directly naming the high
and holy name of the Almighty even in their public ministrations,
or too freely or familiarly, as they might think,
descanting on some of the solemn truths of Christ`'s kingdom and offices.
However undesirable such a shrinking tendency and habit in preachers,
it does not appear to the editor to have been carried
to any very prevailing or injurious extent;
and the opposite extreme is in his estimation far more to be dreaded in the churches,
and more offensive in the divine sight,
inasmuch as a little of that which is living and genuine,
is better than the most complete display of Christian doctrine and privileges,
not adequately attended with the heavenly power and authority of the gift.

To be "`a sweet savour of Christ`" both "`in them that are saved and in
them that perish,`" and thus to make "`manifest the savour of his knowledge
in every place,`" is the business of all true Christians,
whatever be their station in the church, their individual condition,
or the times in which they are cast.
Joseph Oxley was known as such a Christian, in his day and in his measure,
by some that are now living.
Of Joseph Pike, the editor has met with the following pleasing testimony,
made by an estimable Friend, William Pattison, at the date of 1774,
and in the eightieth year of his age.
He said,
"`he had often to remember many of the worthies of the first rank in our Society,
when he was but a young man, namely, William Penn and several others of this nation;
also he remembered to have seen several weighty Friends from Ireland,
particularly William Edmundson, Joseph Pike, John Barcroft, George Rook, Joseph Gill,
etc.; the sight of whom, he often thought, did him good; for their weighty,
solid deportment struck an awe upon him that never departed from him.`"

The above sentence brings strongly before the mind
of the editor some observations made by James Gough,
in the journal of his life,
respecting the early state and character of our religious body and of its leaders,
so far back as his recollection would carry him, he being born as late as the year 1712.
This individual resided many years in Ireland,
and his remarks chiefly relating to Friends in that nation,
appear the more appropriate to be here revived,
as closely bearing upon Joseph Pike`'s fervent concern on behalf of the Society there,
and as unfolding also the progress of that degeneracy,
which was then breaking in upon our little church.

____
God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God,
and they shall be my people.
Therefore come out from among them, and be separate,`" says the Lord,
"`and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you,
and you shall be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.`"
By this call were our honourable predecessors in the beginning
separated from the spirit and ways of the world,
and incited to refuse touching the unclean thing,
or whatever sprang from an impure source,
whatever persecution their refusal might cost them;
knowing that He whom they obeyed and in whom they trusted,
would carry them through all opposition:
this they experienced to their unspeakable joy to be fulfilled,
and testified to the world, many of them, both living and dying.
In those days the meetings of Friends were eminently favoured with divine power,
as they lived more devoted to Christ,
and consequently more abounding with his love flowing in their hearts.
I remember when a child some whose very countenances seemed to command awe,
and impress observers with serious consideration; as the salt of the earth,
seasoning those among whom they walked,
with a sense of the truth which lived and predominated in them.
Those happy men and women left the Lord`'s vineyard,
through their faithful labours with the divine blessing upon them, well fenced and clean,
having gathered out the stones thereof,
and abounding with the excellent fruits of the holy Spirit of Christ.

Many of our dear honourable Friends of the first generation, appear,
from the time they were drawn to the pure fountain of light, life, and love,
to have adhered thereto with immoveable steadfastness to their last moments:
and a few I have known in my time, that have greatly risen and steadily persevered,
considering the degeneracy of the age,
in a faithful attachment of soul to that grace and truth which is come by Jesus Christ;
and that have washed their robes and made them white in his blood,
and have kept their garments unspotted; but very few that came up to this height,
and so continued as with their feet fixed upon Mount Zion;
very few that have got over the opposing mountains of human respect, selfish regards,
sensual appetites, desires of the ease, honours, or profits of the world;
all which tend to debase the soul, darken the judgment,
eclipse the brightness of heavenly light; blunt the edge of godly resolutions,
and contract the corrupting leaven and spirit of the world.
It is lamentable to reflect, how many in our age,
even of the anointed sons and servants of the Lord,
have by these means gradually declined and dwindled, and at length totally fallen off,
as Judas did from Christ, and Demas from his faithful apostle,
made shipwreck of faith and of a good conscience,
and brought lasting disgrace on themselves and that good cause,
in which they had been humbly and honestly engaged.
Yet truth changes not.
It is the same still, and still able to preserve from falling, to build up,
and give an inheritance among the sanctified.

At my first going to Ireland about the year 1737,
there were yet living in most parts of the nation where meetings were settled,
some of the good old stock, both ministers and elders, who loved God and mankind,
and were esteemed and beloved, being kind and open-hearted,
as well as faithful and circumspect in all branches of our Christian testimony,
closely uniting in tender love one with another in supporting
and keeping things in good order in the church.
Their pious care herein was like a fence about the flock,
which kept them together in nearer unity and greater safety,
so that the young people in most parts were generally trained up
in innocence of manners and in plainness of apparel and speech.

In process of time, these worthy men and women,
in whose hearts the love of God and his people had by long growth become deeply rooted,
one after another honourably finished their course,
leaving an excellent savour behind them; but when they were removed,
very few of the youth or others succeeded them in the right line,
to fill up their vacant places with propriety.
Of their survivors, on the one hand,
a considerable number retained the ancient plainness of language and apparel,
and rigidly censorious of any deviation therefrom, valued themselves upon this,
as if it were the only test and badge of discipleship;
while their hearts were gone after their covetousness,
in eagerly pursuing and sordidly hoarding temporal wealth.
On the other hand, a large body of youth and others were shooting up in self-indulgence,
in conformity to the world, and rushing headlong into the temptations of the times.
Yet, amidst this inundation of negligence and revolt,
there remained in most places a number of sincere-hearted Friends,
a few worthy ministers and elders:
but within these twenty years past there has been a great alteration for the worse.
The love of God in many waxes cold!
How they make light of religious duties!
What a slender attendance of Week-day Meetings for the worship of God,
as well as those which are held for our united care of the good of the church.
So that it may now be said of many, as in sorrowful days formerly,
"`The ways of Zion mourn, because none come to her solemn feasts.`"

Again, what restlessness in meetings, what outward indications of spiritual indolence,
of absent or wandering minds, of neglect of the awful duty of worship,
due from us to our great Creator!
What gazing about, or falling asleep!
What violations of our Christian testimony in its sundry branches,
what weakness in conduct, and inconsistency with that divine principle which we profess!
Again,
how many in these perilous days run back and draw
others with them into the vanities of the times,
into a conformity with the world both in dress and address,
into the company of such as indulge the same dispositions, till the plain,
honest manners of sincere and affectionate Friends are falling into disuse,
being such as some are ashamed of.
From these pernicious liberties have proceeded mixed marriages,
running out to the priests, confusion in families,
affliction and anguish of parents,--painful wounds to our Christian Society.

If we look over our Society in this nation +++[+++Ireland],
and take a view both of those who are plain in dress and who are otherwise,
how many have their minds fast rooted in this present world,
devoting all their talents to it, rejecting the counsel of Christ,
who directs us to "`seek first the kingdom of God.`"
Hence, in some places, what poor lifeless meetings!
How little of the sacred fire of divine love burning!
How little of the glory of God shining!
No living minister left among them, and scarce one living member of the body of Christ,
to feel for the others, and take some tender care of them for their good;
their lamps gone out, and scarcely any oil retained in a single vessel.
Thus have some meetings died away and are lost; and others appear to be in a languid,
sickly condition, seeming scarcely likely to live long,
except they timely apply to the great and good Physician,
who is both able and willing to restore life, health, soundness and vigour,
to raise up "`judges as at the first and counsellors as at the beginning.`"
____

Certainly, the painful picture thus held up to us to ponder over,
must be admitted as conveying, in very faithful though vivid colours,
not only a historical delineation of the past,
but likewise of some of the actual tendencies and outgoings of our day;
on these it is very needful we should bear to dwell,
so as duly and profitably to be humbled before the Lord because of them,
and in order that the remedy may be the more heartily sought for, clearly seen,
and thoroughly availed of.--"`The whole head is sick,
and the whole heart faint,`" cried the mournful prophet!
but such prophets in such times are deemed but as fools,
and the spiritual man mad.
Thus Satan contrives by one specious device or another, to block up the way of return,
and to render void the reiterated efforts,
the patient exercises of "`the preserved of Israel`" and the Lord`'s
"`hidden ones,`" for the furtherance of that work of reformation,
which will yet ultimately be the total and eternal downfall of the kingdom of darkness.
The writings of the ancient prophets,
being mainly designed both to rally and to warn backsliding Israel,
are full of consolation and encouragement, of denunciation and judgment also,
adapted to a decrepit, weakly, morbid state of things;
and the work which some of them had to do,
was to rouse up and stimulate the fainting energies of those sincere in heart,
who were ready to say, "`My strength and my hope is perished from the Lord.`"
Among these, how beautiful,
how animating to the drooping courage and fainting spirits of such,
is the language of the prophecy of Zechariah,
in various parts! and how desirable to have faith to appreciate
what belongs to us and to our children therein,
and which was written for our instruction,
"`upon whom the ends of the world are come,`" "`that we through
patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.`"

[.offset]
"`Turn unto me, says the Lord of hosts, and I will turn unto you.`"

[.offset]
And when the inquiry went forth,
"`How long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah?`"
the condescending answer was conveyed "`with good words and comfortable words.`"

[.offset]
"`I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies.`"

[.offset]
"`My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad,
and the Lord shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.`"

[.offset]
"`I will be unto her a wall of fire round about,
and will be the glory in the midst of her.`"

[.offset]
"`I will save you, and you shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong.`"

[.offset]
"`Turn to the strong hold, you prisoners of hope.`"

Those who desire in uprightness to have a part in such "`good things to come,`"
assuredly must be made willing to labour for an entrance into this promised "`rest`"
and "`refreshing;`" since it is "`the willing and obedient,`" and they alone,
who "`shall eat the good of the land.`"
Although it be written, that "`except the Lord build the house,
they labour in vain who build it;`" yet we may remember for our encouragement,
it is also written, "`The God of heaven, he will prosper us,
therefore we his servants will arise and build,`" and, on the other hand,
for our warning, "`By much slothfulness the building decays,
and through idleness of the hands the house drops through.`"
That was a beautifully clear and simple assertion,
uttered by Ezra and his fellows before the king,
the undeviating truth of which they knew full well,
as the servants of the Most High have ever found,--"`The
hand of the Lord is upon all those for good that seek him.`"
It was not however enough, that, on that memorable occasion,
these exemplary reformers mourned, and fasted,
and even "`sat astonished,`" in the view of abounding desolations,
and also entreated the Lord for the revival of that good work,
which he himself had stirred them up to set their hearts towards;
they were instructed of him to set their own hands to it in his fear,
and with an eye to his aid and blessing.
They were given to see not only what they were to do,
but what in various respects they were to undo and to forbear to do; in effect,
"`ceasing to do evil,`" while learning and attempting "`to do well,`" honestly
and utterly refraining from everything with which the Lord had a controversy,
under that dispensation, even from "`all appearance of evil.`"
And surely, in our day of greater privileges,
a similar engagement of mind should rest upon those who would build up Zion,
who "`take pleasure in her stones and favour the dust thereof.`"

This consistency of care, this holy propriety in all their proceedings,
was evinced by Joseph Pike, as it has in measure been kept in view by every wise-hearted,
watchful, weighty elder in the church of Christ, both before and since his time.

Our Yearly Meeting,
in putting forth a few years back a new edition of
its [.book-title]#Rules of Discipline# for the government of Friends,
makes this judicious remark:--"`It is very observable in the history of our Society,
that the declension or revival of religious zeal has ever been accompanied by
a corresponding relaxation or increase of care in the exercise of the discipline.`"
_Introduction to Rules of Discipline,_ p. 25.--[.book-title]#The Journal of Joseph Pike,#
and some of his letters, furnish a fresh and strong illustration on this point,
setting forth on the one hand the obligation and benefits of genuine church authority,
and on the other the woeful effects of negligence and false liberty,
especially in any of those who should be "`examples to the flock.`"^
footnote:[The editor takes this opportunity of making reference
expressly to two or three letters from one of his correspondents,
Deborah Bell, as coming from a deeply exercised soul, baptized under a suffering sense,
of that departure from primitive faithfulness,
which some experienced servants of the Lord in the present day have painfully to deplore.]
Our religious body in Ireland has from the first been zealous in forwarding,
and exact in fulfilling this branch of Christian duty,
the maintenance of mutual guardianship and subordination;
and however slightly or unworthily some may indulge in thinking of their labour of love,
as overstrained in some respects,
this was not the opinion of able and judicious men with
regard to the times of Joseph Pike and his coadjutors.

William Penn, in the year 1698, when on a religious visit to that land,
addressed an epistle to the Yearly Meeting in London,
which was also signed by his companions in travel,
wherein they strongly mark their sense of the superior state of the discipline,
and the exemplary degree of oversight in that portion of the church,
which their system and methods embraced.

So that, dear brethren, +++[+++they remark,]
we have good tidings to give you of truth`'s prosperity at large;
and more especially in the church,
having had the comfort of the General Meeting of this nation,
consisting of many weighty brethren and sisters from all parts thereof,
which was held in the city of Dublin, in much love, peace and unity for several days;
wherein we had occasion to observe their commendable
care for the prosperity of the blessed truth,
in all the branches of its holy testimony, both in the general and in the particular;
improving the good order that is practised among the churches of Christ in our nation.
Indeed their simplicity, gravity and coolness in managing their church affairs;
their diligence in meetings, both for worship and business;
their dispatch in ending differences, and expedients to prevent them;
but especially their zeal against covetousness,
and against indifferency in truth`'s service,
and exemplary care to discourage an immoderate concern
in pursuit of the things of this life,
and to excite Friends to do good with what they are possessed of,
while they have it and time to do good with it;--these have very greatly comforted us.
And, in the sweet and blessed power of Christ Jesus, the meetings ended,
and Friends departed.
The Lord grant that you also may make the same purpose the travail of your souls,
and end of your labour and service of love, as not seeking your own things,
but the things of Jesus Christ, in this your solemn General Meeting.

In the [.book-title]#Journal of Thomas Story# we likewise have this remark in commendation
of the religious care of Friends over their own body in that country.

The same afternoon was their meeting for business, at Mountmellick,
where things were managed with a just severity against every appearance of evil,
to the great comfort of the upright, and discouragement of evildoers;
a great instrument of exact discipline being that ancient and worthy Friend,
William Edmundson, who lived within the precincts of that meeting: for whom,
not they only, but also all Ireland, may give thanks to the Lord,
for due observation of order in the churches of Christ in that kingdom.

The editor has thus expatiated in a manner,
which nothing but his undiminished fervency of interest in all that appertains
to the wellbeing of this Society could warrant or perhaps excuse;
but which the affecting position of some portions of it, of recent times,
superadded to its previous weakly condition, seemed to call for at his hands.
He may be thought by some to have exceeded what was required of him,
in the humble character of editor, on such an occasion; and his authors, both of them,
may also be liable to the imputation of tediousness or insipidity as to style and quality.
Such a judgment he is prepared to expect from those, who, it is to be feared,
"`seeing see not,`" "`neither do they understand,`" though they say, "`We see.`"
Leaning to their own understandings, and the strength of their own spirits,
rather than waiting to receive "`the spirit of wisdom and revelation,`"
to enlighten "`the eyes of their understandings,`" what wonder if,
like some of old, they are in degree blind to the things of the kingdom,
to that which goes to make up the excellency and
simplicity and purity of the truth as it is in Jesus?
Instead of being prepared to adopt the petition, "`That which I see not,
teach me,`" they are in danger of the woe which attaches
to those that are wise and prudent in their own sight;
preferring to be their own masters and their own judges in religious matters,
is it marvellous,
if the language should be found written against them as upon their stout walls,
and high towers, and even upon their very altars,
"`You are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knows your hearts:
for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God?`"
These love to gather to their own heap,
and "`sacrifice unto their own net:`" they cannot rightly "`pray for the peace of Jerusalem,`"
for they know not that "`quiet habitation,`" where every man sits under his own vine,
and drinks water out of his own cistern;
but rather seem to delight to look upon Zion in her defiled or beclouded condition,
in a state of comparative stripping, of scattering, and of shame.
"`Aha!
Aha! our eye has seen it!
Ah! so would we have it "`--If the editor please not such as these,
he will not be disconcerted nor discouraged.

With regard, however, to his readers in general, and especially a small, but chosen,
and increasing band, whether avowedly belonging to our religious denomination or not,
who are little in their own eyes, poor in spirit,
trembling at the presence of the Most High,
yet loving and looking for the spiritual appearing of Jesus Christ,
both as the evidence of his mercy towards them,
and as the earnest of their inheritance in him,--with regard to such as these,
wherever and however situated,
who have of late been strongly drawn towards each other in the Lord,--they will,
he trusts, be far otherwise minded:--they well know, through much anguish, weariness,
and wading of spirit,
how to estimate whatever in the slightest or simplest manner genuinely tends
to the exaltation of our blessed Redeemer`'s kingdom of righteousness,
peace, and truth in the earth.
These sigh for the times of more ample reformation in the church,
the more perfect restoration of her ancient lustre, dignity, strength,
and dominion over the man of sin; and to them nothing is immaterial, or of little worth,
nothing is burdensome, which may tend, as the cup of cold water,
to the reviving of the hearts of the Lord`'s heritage.

It is for the sake of this class, both among his fellow-professors,
and others of a retired, seeking, contrite description,
who have been the more attracted towards our Christian principles,
in consequence of the calumnious outcry raised against them, that the editor is induced,
before he lays down the pen,
to spread before his friends a deeply important quotation from a writer,
who was far more worthy than he is,
and better qualified to address the churches in "`a day of trouble and of treading down,
and of perplexity,`" "`of rebuke and of blasphemy`" also.

"`The church is called the body of Christ.`"
"`Christ is called the head of the church.`"
"`The church is called the pillar and ground of the truth.`"
Thus the church has a name that is sacred, and the necessity of keeping this name holy,
appears evident.
For where a number of people unite in a profession of being led by the Spirit of Christ,
and publish their principles to the world,
the acts and proceedings of that people may in some measure
be considered as such which Christ is the author of.

Now, while we stand in this station,
if the pure light of life is not followed and regarded in our proceedings,
we are in the way of profaning the holy name,
and of going back toward that wilderness of sufferings and persecutions, out of which,
through the tender mercies of God, a church has been gathered.
"`Christ lives in sanctified vessels,`" and where they behold his holy name profaned,
and the pure Gospel light eclipsed,
through the unfaithfulness of any who by their station appear
to be standard-bearers under the Prince of Peace,
the living members in the body of Christ, in beholding these things,
do in some degree experience the fellowship of his sufferings.
And as the wisdom of the world more and more takes place
in conducting the affairs of this visibly gathered church,
and the pure leadings of the holy Spirit are less waited for and followed,
so the true suffering seed is more and more oppressed.

My mind is often affected with a sense of the condition of sincere-hearted
people in some kingdoms where liberty of conscience is not allowed,
many of whom being burdened in their minds with prevailing
superstition joined with oppressions,
are often under sorrow.
And where such have attended to that pure light,
which has in some degree opened their understandings,
and for their faithfulness thereto have been brought to examination and trial,
how heavy are the persecutions which in various parts
of the world are exercised upon them!
How mighty as to the outward is that power, by which they are borne down and oppressed!

There have been in times past severe persecutions under the English government,
and many sincere-hearted people have suffered death for the testimony of a good conscience,
whose faithfulness in their day has ministered encouragement to others,
and been a blessing to many who have succeeded them.
Thus, from age to age, the darkness being more and more removed, a channel at length,
through the tender mercies of God,
has been opened for the exercise of the pure gift of the Gospel ministry,
without interruption from outward power; a work, the like of which is rare,
and unknown in many parts of the world.

As these things are often fresh in my mind,
and this great work of God going on in the earth has been open before me,
that liberty of conscience with which we are favoured has appeared not as a light matter.
A trust is committed to us, a great and weighty trust,
to which our diligent attention is necessary.
Wherever the active members of this visible gathered church use
themselves to that which is contrary to the purity of our principles,
it appears to be a breach of this trust, and one step back toward the wilderness,
one step towards undoing what God in infinite love has done
through his faithful servants in a work of several ages,
and like laying the foundation for future sufferings.

I feel a living invitation in my mind to such who are active in our religious Society,
that we may lay to heart this matter, and consider the station in which we stand:
a place of outward liberty, under the free exercise of our conscience towards God,
not obtained but through great and manifold afflictions of those who lived before us.
There is gratitude due from us to our heavenly Father,
and justice to our posterity:--can our hearts endure, or our hands be strong,
if we desert a cause so precious, if we turn aside from a work,
under which so many have patiently laboured?

May the deep sufferings of our Saviour be so dear to us,
that we may never trample underfoot the adorable Son of God,
nor count the blood of the covenant unholy!
May the faithfulness of the martyrs, when the prospect of death by fire was before them,
be remembered!
And may the patient,
constant sufferings of the upright-hearted servants
of God in latter ages be revived in our minds!
And may we so follow on to know the Lord, that neither the faithful in this age,
nor those in ages to come, may ever be brought under suffering,
through our sliding back from the work of reformation in the world.

While the active members in the visible gathered church stand upright,
and the affairs thereof are carried on under the leadings of the holy Spirit,
although disorders may arise among us,
and cause many exercises to those who feel the care of the churches upon them; yet,
while these continue under the weight of the work,
and labour in the meekness of wisdom for the help of others,
the name of Christ in the visible gathered church may be kept sacred.
But while they who are active in the affairs of this church
continue in a manifest opposition to the purity of our principles,
this, as the prophet Isaiah expresses it, is as when a standard-bearer faints.
And thus the way opens to great and prevailing degeneracy, and to sufferings for such,
who through the power of divine love are separated to the Gospel of Christ,
and cannot unite with anything which stands in opposition to the purity of it.

The necessity of an inward stillness has under these exercises appeared clear to my mind:
in true silence strength is renewed; the mind herein is weaned from all things,
but as they may be enjoyed in the divine will.
Where the fruits of that spirit which is of the world,
are brought forth by many who profess to be led by the Spirit of Truth,
and cloudiness is felt to be gathering over the visible gathered church,
the sincere in heart who abide in true stillness,
and are exercised therein before the Lord for his name`'s sake,
have a knowledge of Christ in the fellowship of his sufferings:
and inward thankfulness is felt at times,
that through divine love our own wisdom is cast out,
and that forward active part in us subjected,
which would rise and do something in the visible gathered church,
without the pure leadings of the Spirit of Christ.

While anything remains in us different from a perfect resignation of our wills,
it is like a seal to a book wherein is written that good
and acceptable and perfect will of God concerning us;
but when our minds entirely yield to Christ, that silence is known,
which follows the opening of the last of the seals, Rev. 8:1. In this silence,
we learn abiding in the divine will, and there feel that we have no cause to promote,
but that only in which the light of life directs us in our proceedings;
and that the alone way to be useful in the church of Christ,
is to abide faithfully under the leadings of his holy Spirit in all cases;
and being thereby preserved in purity of heart and holiness of conduct,
a testimony to the purity of his government may be held forth through us to others.
