== Part II.

=== Section I.

This Second Part gives some account of my spiritual travels,
and the various exercises of soul I have passed through and experienced
in the way of regeneration from my youth upward:--And further shows,
that when, by the operation of the holy Light and Spirit of the Lord upon my soul,
I had attained to some degree of spiritual growth in my own particular,
a concern of spirit came upon me for the prosperity of Truth in general,
and a necessity to unite with faithful brethren for the discharge
of the discipline in the church of Christ:--Treating also of church
government in the Apostles`' times and in our own,
showing how nearly they agree:--With some account of my journeys, voyages, etc.

Though the spiritual exercises which I have gone through
in my pilgrimage were so imprinted in my mind,
by deep affliction, that I cannot forget them while memory lasts; yet,
as they had been often and livingly revived in my remembrance,
by the same Spirit which brought me through them,
as also with pressure of mind to commit something thereof to writing;
so I waited the Lord`'s time in order to be assisted therein by the Holy Remembrancer,
that what I write may be a living and divine sense
of that which I experienced in former times.
In my so waiting, I found a sweet openness to proceed; and therewith,
I was drawn into a divine commemoration of the Lord`'s wonderful mercies, deliverances,
and inexpressible goodness towards me, from my childhood, up to this day; for which,
my soul, with great reverence, doth humbly bow unto Him, as with my mouth in the dust,
giving the praise to his holy and eternal Name;
beseeching that He would be graciously pleased to
keep and preserve me to the end of my days,
that so he may give me an eternal inheritance among the sanctified,
in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
Amen, saith my soul.

Before I was seven years of age, the Spirit of the Lord began to work in my mind,
and strove with me, to bring me off from childish playfulness and vanities.
His holy light in my soul, as I soon after found it to be, convinced me,
that I ought not to give way to, nor do this, or the other thing which presented;
and when, at any time, I did what I should not have done,
it brought upon me trouble and condemnation, even in those early days,
as it hath always since, when I did any thing that offended the Lord.
If this were a proper place for it,
I could enlarge abundantly upon the divine nature of this holy
principle of the Light and Spirit of Jesus Christ in the soul,
of which the Holy Scriptures so largely testify; however,
I shall be led to do it in part in the process of this history,
knowing from my own certain experience, that it is no principle of our nature,
nor any innate notion of our minds, for nothing of or from our own fallen nature,
can show or convince us of sin.
Though I did not presently know,
that it was the Lord`'s Spirit which I felt working in me,
as Samuel knew not the Lord`'s voice, when a child, yet being convinced in myself,
by its holy convictions,
that I ought not to do those things which brought trouble upon me, and also,
that when at any time I refrained from doing what caused this trouble,
I had sweet peace and satisfaction of mind,
it made me the more to attend to its dictates,
and drew me off from many childish actions, which youth are prone to; whereby,
I grew into sobriety beyond many of my age, until I came to be about nine years old.

But in a little time after, I began by degrees to lose this condition;
and I well remember, how the enemy of my soul worked in a mystery,
insinuating into my mind, "`What harm, or evil is there in things,
which are accounted innocent diversions?`"
And being of a lively, active temper, this bait took with me;
so that my mind was drawn off from attending to the
convictions of the Lord`'s Holy Spirit in my heart,
which did often bring trouble and condemnation upon me.
Beginning to love playful pastimes,
I lost that inward sweetness and peace which I had before enjoyed;
and by endeavouring to stifle these secret reproofs, I grew harder, until,
from a desire to keep company with other wild boys,
I took delight in getting out into the streets to play with them,
so that I grew very wanton, although my dear parents endeavoured to restrain me.
After I had been associating with such companions, when I came to be a little still,
the Lord`'s judgments would seize me, and bring me under great trouble of soul;
then I would resolve to refrain, and do so no more.
Yet perhaps the next temptation that offered, I could not withstand,
but fell into the same snare again.

Thus it was with me, until I came to be about twelve years of age; although,
to the praise of the Lord, I was preserved from any very wicked or gross actions,
or even very bad words, yet my mind was drawn away into vanity and wildness,
and I was far from being so sober as I ought to have been.

And here,
I may be allowed to make a cautionary digression concerning
parents.--If they have any regard to the good of their children,
they should keep a very strict hand over them,
especially when they are prone to wildness, as I was; for,
had not my parents been careful over me, I had been worse than I was.
And although my dear mother would never indulge me in any evil practice, being a prudent,
discreet woman; yet she loved me exceedingly, which I well knew,
and therefore in some measure I presumed upon it, and ventured abroad at some times,
which I should not have done, had she corrected me oftener.
I would advise and caution all parents to take particular
care of their children in going to and returning from school,
lest they fall into company that would certainly corrupt them;
likewise to keep them from walking abroad on first-days, or those called holy days,
for such times are the most dangerous,
and they are then most liable to fall in the way of idle company, to their great hurt.
From my own experience I can say, that by giving way at first to small hurtful things,
the enemy gets advantage, gradually stealing in,
and drawing away the mind into greater evils.
Therefore it is, that we are commanded to abstain from every appearance of evil,
which we cannot do, but by the assistance of the Lord`'s Holy Spirit,
and taking up the cross of Christ to every such appearance,
whereby we witness an overcoming of the assaults and temptations of Satan.

I now saw, in the light, that if I persisted in vanity and wildness,
I was in the way of destruction; and when the terrors of the Lord were upon me,
I would take up fresh resolutions to refrain from and avoid such conduct.
But these resolutions came to nothing, being made in my own strength; for, perhaps,
the very next temptation would prevail, and then again,
the Lord`'s righteous judgments laid hold upon me;
thus I repeatedly made work for repentance.

At this time, 1669,
we had no afternoon meetings in the room where meetings for public worship were held,
but we had evening meetings, which were held at Friends`' houses alternately.
William Edmundson of Rosenallis, that worthy and honourable Friend and father in Israel,
was concerned about this time to visit Friends of this province; and being at Cork,
the evening meeting fell in course at the house of the widow, Bridget Denis,
who became a faithful Friend, and towards her latter end had a testimony for Truth,
and I doubt not died in the Lord.
To this meeting I went, with great heaviness and sorrow upon my soul,
under a mournful sense of my repeated transgressions against the Lord;
and also with earnest cries, that He would be pleased to forgive me,
and for the time to come, grant me power and strength over the temptations of the enemy;
for I clearly saw, that I was not capable, by any ability of my own,
to preserve myself from the least evil, agreeably to the saying of our blessed Lord,
"`Without me ye can do nothing.`"
I sat down in the meeting full of sorrow; and William Edmundson`'s testimony,
so reached my inward state and condition, and pierced my very soul,
that I could not refrain crying out in the meeting, under a sense of my sins,
and of the Lord`'s terrors and judgments,
which I then felt beyond what I had ever before experienced.
And I was, at that time,
as truly baptized by the powerful preaching of the word of life by him, as those were,
to whom the apostle Peter preached, Acts 2:37. Then, oh! then, were my sins,
and the sinfulness of them, set before me; and in the agony and bitterness of my soul,
I secretly cried unto the Lord, for the pardon and remission of them,
with humble prayers unto Him,
that he would be pleased to enable me by his Holy Spirit
to walk more circumspectly for the time to come,
and do his holy will,
and that I might truly serve and worship him in spirit and in truth.

But the Lord`'s heavy judgments continued upon me for a considerable time,
how long I cannot exactly remember, but I believe for some months,
until I became obedient to his divine light and good Spirit in my soul,
without which I could not perform anything that was acceptable to God.
And I have since found by living experience,
that although our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, by his sufferings and death,
placed me and all mankind in a condition capable of salvation,
yet the completion thereof was, and is, in our obedience to his Holy Spirit,
a measure of which, according to Scripture, he hath given to each of us,
"`to profit withal,`" that we may thereby work out our own salvation.

After the baptizing power of the Lord had thus seized upon me,
I had dominion given me over those temptations,
which had before so often prevailed upon me, and I grew easier in spirit,
and had great sweetness and comfort.
My companions wondered at this alteration; and when I passed them in the street,
I have overheard them say one to another, "`What`'s the matter with Joe Pike?
he won`'t speak to us;`" at which I rejoiced greatly in my heart,
with humble thanks to the Lord,
that he had given me so much power and victory over the
temptations into which I had before so often fallen.
Then did I begin to love the Lord, and I delighted to turn my mind inward,
and diligently to wait upon him, by the help of his Holy Spirit,
by which I gradually grew in experience and knowledge of the things of God.
Oh! then how did I love to go to meetings! and I longed for the meeting days;
and when there, endeavoured to have my mind inwardly exercised towards the Lord,
whom I loved with all the powers of my soul.
Oh! how near and dear to me were the faithful ministering servants of the Lord,
as also other faithful Friends, in whose company I greatly delighted,
and loved to hear them speak of the things of God;
my mind being wholly taken off from the vanities, plays, and pastimes of the world,
__all was nothing to me!__

And when I could, I went into some secret place to wait upon the Lord,
and there I poured out my soul unto him, with overflowing tears of joy,
that he had so mercifully wrought this great change in me; and I may say,
with humble thanksgiving and praise to his holy name,
that he was pleased to accept of my tender offering of a broken heart,
in returning upon my soul at times the sweet incomes
of his divine power and living presence,
to the overcoming of my spirit with unutterable joy.
I have gone to meeting, and whilst there, a living faith attended,
and full assurance has arisen in my soul, that if I diligently waited,
with my mind inwardly exercised towards the Lord, I should feel his life-giving presence;
and according to my faith,
the Lord hath broken in upon my spirit with unspeakable comfort.

The remembrance of such seasons is renewed within me at this time,
for which my soul is melted into tenderness,
with humble thanksgiving and praise to his Holy and Divine Majesty,
that he has kept me alive in spirit now to old age,
to bear this testimony for him from my own experience, that his holy Truth waxes not old,
as doth a garment; for although I am decayed in body, and through the weakness thereof,
seem to be near the brink of the grave, yet to the praise of the Lord, I can say,
I am as strong in him and in the power of his might,
and feel my spirit as zealous for his Holy Name and testimony, as at any time of my life;
for which, all that is within me magnifies and extols, even with my mouth in the dust,
the holy and eternal name of the Lord of heaven and earth, who liveth forever and ever!

Before I had reached my fourteenth year, by the Lord`'s Holy Spirit working in me,
I came to witness a state of purity, holiness, and innocency; in which,
not so much as a vain or foolish thought could arise in my mind,
but the holy light of Christ did presently let me see it and judge it,
so that I abhorred all evil thoughts, words and actions,
and loved truth and righteousness with all my soul.
I dearly loved all faithful Friends, and felt them as dear to me as my own life;
and they loved me, being sensible I loved the Lord.

And here, let me add a caution to all ministers and elders,
to take great care of any undue liberty in words or behaviour,
before such as are young and tender in the Truth, whether in youth or riper age;
for the newly convinced are very sharp in observation; and if they observe anything,
whether it be in more words than are necessary, or in behaviour,
which they think not agreeable to that solidity the Truth leads into,
it is apt to stumble or confuse them.
We find, the great apostle Paul was very tender over those who were young and weak,
and denied himself of lawful things, lest he should offend them, and said,
though all things were lawful, yet all things were not expedient.

Notwithstanding I had, by the power and Spirit of the Lord,
attained to a state of purity, yet, alas!
I lost it again, for want of true and diligent watchfulness to the light,
and closely following the leadings of it, and not through any gross evil I had committed.
Between the age of fourteen and fifteen,
I began to grow more negligent in waiting upon the Lord,
and thence into more coldness of love to him,
and so by degrees to lose that tender frame of spirit I had formerly witnessed.
And then the enemy of my soul, tempted me with the pleasures and vanities of the world,
so that my mind was allured and drawn towards them, and I did love and delight therein.
Among the rest, I was inclined to take pleasure in fine apparel, and the like,
as I could get them, according to my station, of which I remember a particular instance.
Having got a pretty fine new coat, the spirit of pride arose in me,
and passing along the street, (I remember the place,) I thought myself, as the saying is,
somebody, but amidst these vain and foolish thoughts,
I was in an instant struck as with an arrow from the Lord,
and it swiftly passed through my mind after this manner,
"`Poor wretch! was not Jesus Christ, the Lord of heaven and earth, meek and low of heart,
and his appearance mean on earth?
He was not proud and high; wilt thou,
poor worm! be high and proud of thyself or clothes?`"
These thoughts so wounded my spirit, that I went home very sorrowful and dejected;
but this went off in a little time,
for the delights of the world began to take root in me, and my mind went after them,
by which I was drawn away from the Lord.

And I bear my testimony, that the adorning of the body with fine apparel,
and fashionable cuts, as well as superfluity in household furniture,
is utterly inconsistent with that plainness which the holy Truth leads into.
It led our ancients out of such things, and to testify against them;
for most certain it is, that though pride first springs in the heart, yet,
by delighting in outside things, the mind becomes captivated thereby,
and the root of vanity grows inwardly stronger and stronger.

My mind having thus gone astray from the Lord, it displeased him,
and caused him to withdraw from me,
so that I did not enjoy the sweetness and comfort of his Holy Spirit,
as I had done before; yet he took it not from me, but it became my judge and condemner,
for loving those things that offended him,
and so the terrors of the Lord often seized me, and I could well remember,
from the strength of my natural memory, how it had been with me,
when I was in favour with the Lord,
and by his holy Light I saw how I had lost the living
sense of the sweetness I had formerly enjoyed,
which made me sorely to lament my present condition.

And, from this experience,
I have learned to understand the vast difference
there is between natural comprehension and memory,
and the present, living,
experimental witnessing of the life and power of Truth upon the soul,
by which the soul is kept alive to God.
Solomon, from the strength of his memory,
could not forget how excellently he had prayed to the Lord by the Holy Spirit,
at the dedication of the temple, and yet he lost that living and divine sense of it,
when he afterwards went into idolatry.
The world has the former; and by the strength of their natural reason, comprehension,
and memory, they read, they study the learned languages, and acquire knowledge,
or rather gather notions, being thus furnished and equipped for what they call divinity.
But, alas! true divinity is quite another thing, and learned quite another way,
even by the Lord`'s Holy Spirit,
and which consists in the enjoyment of his sweet presence in our soul.
I say this, in measure from my own experience,
for when I was obedient to his holy Light and Spirit in my heart, and was taught by it,
it led me, though but childish in my natural understanding,
to the holy hill of spiritual Zion,
even to the enjoyment of his living comfortable presence.
But when I declined from it, though I grew in natural knowledge and understanding,
yet I lost my innocent condition, and the spiritual communion I once had; so that,
instead of his Holy Spirit being my comforter, it became my judge and condemner.
These things livingly flow into my mind,
and I give them forth as a testimony for the Lord,
and to the operation of his holy Spirit.

Thus stood my inward condition, from about the age of fifteen to eighteen;
during which time I maintained a pretty good character amongst Friends and others; for,
through the Lord`'s great mercy, I never fell into any gross or scandalous evils,
nor yet did I keep bad company, but was generally beloved, so far as I knew,
by all that were acquainted with me, notwithstanding which, I was gone from,
and had lost my inward communion and fellowship with the Lord,
that I had formerly witnessed.
This leads me to caution all, whether young or old,
against valuing or justifying themselves upon the morality of their conduct,
and depending upon it, as I have known some to do.
For though a man cannot be a right Christian, without being a good moralist,
yet he may sustain a moral character, and be very far from being a true Christian,
and acceptable to God: this I can speak from my own experience.

When about eighteen years old,
the Lord was graciously pleased to grant me a renewed visitation,
not in that sudden and extraordinary manner as before, but in a more gradual way.
He did arise, and give me a full and clear sight of my condition,
and how I was estranged from him in spirit; and that if I continued therein,
I should grow harder and harder, and in the end, be undone forever.
The sense of this brought me into great horror and distress, with bitter lamentation;
under which I lay some time,
until the Lord was mercifully pleased to tender my spirit a little,
and assist me to pray unto him for a repentant heart, on account of my past disobedience,
in so ungratefully departing from him, which indeed lay as a mill-stone upon my soul,
and brought me into sore agony and distress of spirit.
I then sought to be alone, in unseen places,
where I often poured out my soul unto the Lord, with many tears,
begging for mercy and forgiveness; for I saw that I had come to a great loss,
and that I must unlearn many things that I had learned
in the night of my apostasy in spirit from him,
though not in principle or profession,
during which the evil root and nature had grown strong in me.
I also saw, that nothing could destroy this, but the axe, the sword, the hammer,
and the fire of his Holy Spirit, and that I must be regenerated and born again,
before I could ever attain to the condition I had lost,
and which the light of Jesus let me see very clearly.

Then, oh! then, the agony, the horror that seized my soul, I am not able to express it.
I often thought no one`'s condition was ever like mine; when I turned my mind inward,
my soul seemed like a habitation of dragons, which were ready to devour me;
evil thoughts, of many kinds, presented themselves; temptations of the wicked one,
that I never was inclined to, beset me.
When I went to meeting, I had no rest there; I could not stay my mind upon the Lord;
so that I was almost ready to run out of it, the enemy seemed so to roar upon me,
as if to destroy my soul.
It appeared to me, that the Lord had wholly withdrawn Himself from me,
and was far from my help.
When night came, I wished for the morning, and when the morning came,
I wished for the evening.
In the night season, I often lay mourning and bitterly weeping,
making my pillow wet with tears.
My distress was such, that if the Lord, in mercy, had not pitied me,
and by granting a little hope and ease of spirit, helped me,
I believe I should have sunk under it, my misery was so great;
for I was at times so overwhelmed with sorrow,
that I was almost in despair of ever getting through my afflictions,
fearing that I was utterly forsaken.

When I had continued in this state a considerable season, ready to faint in spirit,
the Lord did, in his own time, not in mine, neither in so powerful a manner as I desired,
again arise,
with a little of the light of his countenance for the ease of my distressed soul;
which yet continued not long with me.
Then did I fall again into the same misery.
Thus was I afflicted and tossed, as with a tempest,
until I was almost worn out with sorrow;
plunged into spiritual Jordan or judgment again and again, not only seven times,
but more than seventy times seven.
Oh, "`the wormwood and the gall`" that I was made to drink of
in that day! "`my soul hath them still in remembrance,
and is humbled within me.`"
Yet, with thanksgiving and praise to the holy name of the Lord, he brought me through,
at last, and set my feet upon his rock.

During this time of sore affliction, I read the Holy Scriptures,
particularly the book of Psalms, and that evangelical prophet Isaiah,
wherein I found abundance of experiences that suited my condition; and when,
in reading them, the Lord was pleased to influence my mind by his Spirit,
how comfortable were they to me!
Oh! how would my heart be even melted into tenderness,
in finding that some of the experiences of holy men answered to mine,
as face answereth to face in a glass, whereby a hope was raised in me,
that I should get through my exercises, as they did through theirs.
But at other times, when the Lord`'s Spirit seemed to be withdrawn from me,
although I read them, and understood the words,
yet my mind not being influenced and opened by the Lord`'s Spirit,
I received not the same benefit or comfort; and from hence I learned,
by living experience,
that it is by and through the openings of His Spirit that we receive
the true comfort or profit in reading the Holy Scriptures.

I was in this condition, more or less, for about two or three years; and at times,
when the Lord enabled me to pray to Him, oh! the strong cries that would ascend,
and with most fervent beseechings of soul I did pray, with overflowing tears,
and said in my heart--"`Oh Lord, depart not from me! keep me in this praying condition,
let me not depart out of it! keep me from evil! make me as Thou wouldst have me to be;
for Thou knowest I desire to love thee, better than the whole world, and I will,
with thy assistance, serve thee all the days of my life.`"

But here I was not to stay; not being sufficiently purged;
and had again to go down into judgment, and lie under his spiritual baptism:
then did misery, sorrow, and lamentation again take hold of me.
Thus it was with me, from season to season, in my progress heavenwards;
yet with this difference, that those intervals of ease grew longer, during which,
I was ready to say in my heart--"`I hope I shall
never more be moved;`" but again the Lord withdrew,
and hid his face from me for a season, so that my soul was troubled thereby,
yet his grace was with me still; as an anchor at bottom, and as a monitor, guide,
and director, to preserve me from running into any gross evil.
Notwithstanding I was so preserved, for want of keeping close to the guidance of it,
I often offended the Lord in lesser matters; and when I did so in thought, word, or deed,
his divine judgments seized my soul, and therein I rejoiced, and the cry arose within me,
"`Oh! let not thine eye pity, nor thy hand spare,
until judgment be brought forth unto victory, over this evil nature of mine.`"
I would, in the evening, call over my actions during the day,
and when I saw I had spoken more than I ought, or used unnecessary words,
or did anything that grieved the Lord`'s Spirit,
although such words or actions were not condemned by others, yet my heart being tender,
oh! how would I be bowed, and would mourn under the consideration thereof,
with humble prayers to Him that he would enable me to do so no more.

I remember, at one time, after a degree of ease,
that the Lord was pleased to withdraw the light of his countenance,
and seemed to desert me for about three months,
which plunged me into inexpressible sorrow.
When I turned my mind inward, I found no comfort, but my heaven was as iron,
and my earth as brass for hardness and sterility,
and I have been seized with such agony of spirit,
that my flesh seemed to tremble upon my bones!
Then would I examine myself, and say, "`What evil have I committed?
Wherein have I so greatly offended, that the Lord should utterly forsake me?`"
But, blessed be his everlasting name! he did again arise in his own due time,
to the joy and comfort of my heart, and I afterwards saw,
this was for the trial of my faith and patience.
In all this time of my deepest distress, I never opened my mind fully to any one,
but endeavoured to hide my exercises from all mortals,
and appeared as cheerful in countenance as I could,
even at times when my heart seemed ready to break with sorrow;
yet my face did often gather paleness, and some asked, What ailed me?
Was I sick?
But I waved the question,
though I believe some sensible Friends saw that I was under exercise of spirit.

I am thus large, and write these things,
purely for the encouragement of Zion`'s travellers, to trust in the Lord,
and not to despair of his mercy in the deepest of their exercises and afflictions,
by and through all which, I gradually grew in the knowledge of the things of God.
And though, when I was under the deepest of them,
I could not see through them or the end of them; yet, afterwards,
I came to know they were from the Lord,
and that it was a time of the ministration of condemnation,
in order to bring me nearer to the Lord,
by breaking down and mortifying the natural and fleshly part in me,
which had grown strong, and was not to inherit the kingdom of God.
Through these sore exercises and taking up the cross of Christ under them,
my own natural will and affections became much broken, and I was, in measure,
as a little child, depending upon the Lord for strength and ability to do his will.
And by the Lord`'s Spirit I was often led to deny myself of lawful things, as to eating,
drinking, and the putting on of apparel, being too strongly inclined to them.
Moreover, the Lord`'s holy light opened abundance of Scripture to me,
that I understood not before, so that I have said in my heart,
"`The world believes the truth of the Holy Scriptures by tradition,
but those who come to witness the operation of a
measure of the same Spirit in their souls,
from whence the Holy Scriptures proceeded,
are confirmed by their own experience in the truth of them.`"
Thus the work went forward in me, until, in his own due time, I could say in measure,
"`He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay,
and set my feet in some degree upon his rock and measurably established my goings:
Oh! blessed be his everlasting name forever!`"

Though the excess of my troubles and exercises wore off in a few years, and I could,
at times, when so enabled, sing in my soul, as well of the Lord`'s mercies,
as of his judgments; yet I was not, for many years, at seasons,
without sore fights of affliction with the enemy of my soul, nor am I to this day;
for most certain it is, that there is no state attainable on this side the grave,
beyond that of watchfulness.
Our Lord said to his disciples, "`Watch and pray, lest ye fall into temptation.`"
I have compared the soul of man to an outward garden; though it be cleansed from weeds,
yet as it naturally produces them, if it be not watched and kept clean,
the noxious and troublesome weeds will sprout again, and if suffered to grow,
will choke the tender and good seed sown.
Our hearts are "`deceitful, above all things,`" and naturally prone to evil,
and as the prophet adds, "`desperately wicked;`" and,
though by the power and sword of the Lord`'s Spirit,
many things may be as it were destroyed and dead,
yet if we do not diligently watch in the light, the enemy will steal in again,
and revive some of those things which appeared to be eradicated,
especially such as we are naturally most inclined to.

This state my soul has also experienced,
and I think it may be alluded to in the parable of Christ,
relating to the unclean spirit gone out of a man, who,
wandering about and finding no rest, returned to the same house, in man`'s heart,
which being swept and garnished, he taketh other seven spirits, more wicked than himself,
and they enter in, (to be sure, for want of watchfulness,) and dwell there,
and "`the last state of that man,`" says Christ, "`is worse than the first.`"
Thus even one who hath in a good measure been cleansed from his iniquity,
and eased of his inward affliction, may become careless,
and suffer the enemy again to enter, unless he keep inward to the light,
watching unto prayer.
Oh! this inward watching is too much wanting among many of the Lord`'s people;
and therefore many have not grown in the Truth as they might have done,
but have come to a loss, and some have quite fallen away.

The school of Christ and his teachings are within, as saith the apostle,
"`That which may be known of God, is manifest in man:`" there it is,
that he teaches his people himself.
The more we keep inward to this school, the more we learn of Christ;
and the less we keep inward, even when about lawful things, the less we learn of Christ.
Oh! read, you that can read in the mystery of life: there is no safety, no preservation,
no growing in the Truth, but in true humility,
keeping inward to the gift of the Holy Spirit of Christ,
continually watching in the light, against the temptations of the enemy.
Therefore the earnest breathing of my soul to the Lord is,
that he may be graciously pleased to preserve me
in watchfulness to the last moment of my life,
for I well know I cannot preserve myself, nor think a good thought,
nor do the least good thing, as our blessed Lord said, "`Without me, ye can do nothing.`"
But the Holy One of Israel gives strength to the poor and needy in spirit,
by whom alone they stand, and not of themselves: all might, majesty, power, and dominion,
be ascribed unto him, who lives forever and ever!

Having given some relation of the various exercises I have passed through,
I can now from living and certain experience say,
that it is not being educated in the form of truth; it is not the profession of it,
nor being called a Quaker; it is not barely frequenting our religious meetings;
it is not even being of a moral conversation, that will do, or be acceptable to the Lord,
unless we also witness a possession and enjoyment of the Holy Truth,
and the life and power of it, in our souls.
Therefore I earnestly desire, that the professors of it,
and such as have been educated in the form of it, may not rest satisfied therein,
but turn your minds inward to the Lord, to the gift of his Holy Spirit there manifested,
that you may thereby experimentally witness a growth, a progress,
and finally an inheritance in the Lord`'s eternal Truth, of which you make a profession;
for this alone gives true acceptance, and a union and fellowship with Him.

I shall now proceed to mention a concern which gradually came upon me,
to join with faithful brethren,
in the discharge of their duty respecting church discipline;
and as the same Holy Spirit of Christ, led into church government at the first,
so the same necessity remaining now, we are likewise led into the like good order.

When about twenty years of age, I was invited by Friends,
to be a member of the men`'s meeting in Cork; at which time,
I was under a religious exercise of mind, my conversation was sober,
and my exterior plain, according to truth; all which drew the love of Friends towards me.
I thought myself very unworthy, being low and weak in mind,
thinking I could do them no service; but hoping to receive some benefit myself,
I did with fear and caution accept their offer,
and sat among them for some years before I presumed
to speak much to what came before them.
Yet I joined in heart and soul with those who were exercised for the Truth,
and as I grew more and more concerned for its prosperity, when occasion offered,
I spoke more to subjects in meetings.

Our elder brother and father in Israel, George Fox, who, by the Spirit of Truth,
was moved to set up meetings for discipline in the church,
advised that the members should be faithful men and women.
And in my judgment, the lowest qualification of such is,
that they be of orderly conversation, plain and exemplary in their apparel,
ready to take counsel of Friends, no babblers, and faithful in their measure.
Such, by admittance, may receive instruction and edification,
and if they grow in the Truth, may be serviceable in the church; but on the contrary,
if any should be admitted through favour, kindred, or for good natural parts,
without the above qualifications, they are of no service in the church.
Another class have sometimes been admitted, with the good intent of helping them thereby;
but these, not growing in the Truth, have become troublesome to the church;
and I am firmly of the judgment,
that the affairs of the Society cannot be conducted in that unity of spirit,
without due care be taken in the admittance of qualified members.

+++[+++This was not merely an individual sentiment,
it was the judgment and practice of olden and better times.
And we find, that afterwards, when greater latitude was breaking in upon the church,
the following query was instituted,
to be answered from the inferior to the superior meetings:--"`Is
care taken that no unfit persons sit in meetings for discipline?`"
1740+++.+++ So far were our worthy predecessors,
those "`that moulded the sect of the Quakers,`" from retaining "`the worst
arrangements of the church of Rome and the church of England,
or even of the Heathen Brahmins,`" by allowing "`the carnal
birth of those born merely by the will of man,
to enjoy an equal share of all Christian privileges with those who are born in the Spirit.`"
This mistake has been made by other authors besides Beverley,
in his letters on the state of the church.--__Editor.__]

In or about the year 1677, Samuel Randall came from Dublin to live in this city.
He was a sober, religious young man, exemplary in his conversation and apparel.
I soon became acquainted with him, and in time,
our hearts became knit and united together in a degree like that of Jonathan and David.
Our converse was frequent, and our words were solid and savory,
often about religious things, yet not in a forward, talkative spirit,
but as our minds were sweetly opened to it;
and therein we were made a help and strength to each other in the Lord.
I do not remember, that I ever heard him speak an idle word,
during the time of our intimate acquaintance, which was about forty years.
Though his religious gravity was such, he was a man of very sharp, quick, active parts,
and excellent understanding.

In the beginning of this year, William Bingley, from England,
a young man in the ministry, having a living testimony for Truth, came to Cork;
with him I travelled to several meetings; and also with Roger Haydock, Roger Longworth,
James Halliday, and other ministering Friends, as they came to visit us,
for as I grew in Truth, I grew in my love to its faithful Friends.

The same year, I went to England on account of trade; and while at Bristol,
there came many faithful Friends from several parts of the nation,
to have a meeting with the separatists, who had joined John Story, and John Wilkinson:
amongst them were George Fox, George Whitehead, William Penn, and others.
On the other side were Thomas Gouldney, William Ford, Edward Martindale,
and William Rogers, of Bristol, who was their chief speaker.
They accused George Fox with being an innovator, in establishing women`'s meetings,
and giving forth new rules, and orders to the churches, in which, they said,
he endeavoured to make himself a ruler over the consciences of the Lord`'s heritage;
which rules they called the prescriptions of men,
and an imposition upon their consciences; while all ought to see for themselves,
and be left to their own freedom, and to the measure of the gift in themselves,
and not be tied up to such outward forms.
This great meeting and dispute lasted many hours, in which William Rogers took much part.
He was a man of a ready wit and free utterance,
and had been a sensible man in meetings for discipline, while he abode in the Truth,
which he was now got from in himself;
and thereupon his wit and parts were employed in critical turns, vain jangling,
evasive and fallacious arguments,
which through his carnal reasoning he covered over with plausible pretences.

I hearkened diligently and observed what was said on both sides,
much of which I still remember;
but was thoroughly satisfied and convinced of George Fox`'s sincerity and innocency,
and that he was a true man of God, and that what they called outward forms,
were given forth by him, in and through the power of the Lord;
and that his opposers were in a dividing spirit,
that tended to looseness and undue liberty, and would do away all discipline,
which would lay waste the heritage of the Lord;
and I verily believed they would come to nothing, which afterwards proved to be the case.
William Rogers, in particular, though a rich man in the world, became very poor,
grew dark, and lost almost all sense of religion.
Others ran quite out and became hardened,
and many who were innocently betrayed to join with that spirit, returned to Friends,
and condemned that spirit, so that the few separate meetings which were set up,
dwindled away to nothing.

+++[+++The following is a curious and instructive account
of a conference relative to the same division;
it has been handed about among Friends in manuscript, and bears every mark of truth.

John Steel,
who by relation was a plain countryman of not much note or appearance in the Society,
was following his plough, when he found a constraint on his mind to leave home;
but he knew not whither he was to go, nor what service was for him to do,
but was commanded to travel towards a distant part of the nation.
After travelling some distance,
he heard that at a particular place a meeting or conference
was appointed to be held between Friends and John Wilkinson,
and John Story, on account of their separation; thither he found freedom to go;
where William Penn, Robert Barclay, and other eminent Friends, were met on the occasion.
In a little time, John Steel had the following testimony to deliver:

"`The Lord our God, with whom the treasures of wisdom are hid,
in an acceptable time in this our day and generation,
has given his gifts unto his children for the gathering of people out of the world.
If any be unfaithful in the gift, He that gave it will take it away;
then nothing remains but the words which were learned
of the Lord while they had the gift;
and with these words they will war against the Truth,
and against them who have the Gospel order;
for they are now bringing up new things which were not in the beginning,
having the smooth words which man cannot see,
but as their fruits make them manifest and an inward eye is opened.
The doctrine of this spirit is so smooth, that many cannot see a hole in it,
but the nature of it is to divide Friends asunder like stray sheep.
But they go about to support this spirit.
Although they have been engaged in many services for the Lord,
and he honoured them and gave them victory, and clothed them with beautiful garments;
yet if they go about to support this wrong spirit,
their garments shall be torn as the coat of a sheep amongst briars and thorns;
for if any who have received the gift be not faithful unto it,
the Lord shall do as he hath done,
confound them out of the mouths of babes and sucklings:
for neither will nor wealth shall bear rule among the people of God,
but the power of the Lord must go over all, and in that must the rule be.
In the months that are past and the years that are gone, it would not be said,
'`We and they,`' but one God, one people, one Spirit was known; but in process of time,
an evil spirit and power hath entered as leaven, whereby it is said,
'`We and they.`' But the power of the Lord is to pass over,
and by it that is to be destroyed, and one power, one people, and Spirit is to be known,
if ever God`'s salvation is to be known.

"`By that one power of the one God, all are made sensible members of that body,
of which Christ Jesus is the head.
But in process of time, through the subtlety of the devil,
some of these members have been benumbed and lost the sense of feeling.
And now several sensible members, of which Christ is the head, have endeavoured,
time after time, together with the help of the Head,
to seek to recover the benumbed members; but no recovery could be made.
What shall be done to these members?
Shall they be cut off?
Nay, the counsel of God is not so in my heart.
But let them be as near the body as may be,
that if it may be they may again receive virtue from the Head,
and come again to the sense of feeling.
They were seeing members, and did work for God when they did see; but becoming numb,
they are also blind, and it is unto them a continual night: and being in the blindness,
they would be working for God; being used to go abroad when they were sensible,
so they would be going abroad when they are blind.
But what shall be done to these members?
Let them be bound; but if it please God, while they have a being in these tabernacles,
let them be loosed; if not, let them be bound forever.
This is the judgment of God upon you, John Wilkinson and John Story:
if it be not just and equal, reject it if you can.`"
To this they were silent.

The foregoing testimony came with such powerful weight and authority, that it is said,
William Penn remarked to Robert Barclay to this purport:
"`This is neither the wisdom of the north, nor the eloquence of the south,
but the power of God through a ploughman, and marvellous in our eyes.`"
And it is further said, that John`'s testimony had such a reach upon the meeting,
that matters ended presently without much dispute.--__Editor.__]

This year, 1681, Samuel Randall and I went together for England.
We landed at Minehead, thence went to Bridgewater, and so to Bristol.
It was a time of hot persecution over the nation,
and Friends in many places were very great sufferers in body and goods,
by the penal acts then in force.
Abundance of Friends were cast into prison; and the jail and Bridewell at Bristol,
were full of them: I mean, faithful Friends who stood against that separate spirit;
for the others baulked their testimony, and came not to meetings,
and so escaped a prison.
There was no other public meeting kept up in the city,
beside that of a few old men and women, and some zealous young people,
with some children, who met at the meetinghouse door,
which was shut up by the persecutors, to keep Friends out.
Our zeal for Truth was such, that we went to this small meeting,
though much dissuaded from it as being on our journey, and strangers,
and might in all probability be taken prisoners.
Accordingly we were taken, and put into prison by John Knight, sheriff,
a great persecutor, at which we were not at all dismayed.
We were at some sweet and comfortable meetings in the prison;
a living spring of life being among them,
and some mouths were newly opened in a testimony for the Lord.
There we remained a short time, but the widow Lane, though unknown to us,
prevailed with her kinsman the sheriff, to set us at liberty.

From Bristol, we went to London; and there also the meetinghouses were shut up,
Friends meeting at the doors and in the streets near them.
The officers generally carried away some Friends to prison,
yet this did not deter us from attending those meetings; and although Friends were,
as usual, taken away, yet we providentially escaped a prison;
and when our business was accomplished, we returned home to the comfort of our friends.

In the fourth month, 1682, I was married to Elizabeth Rogers,
with the unanimous assent and good liking of all our relations.
The next year, my beloved friend, Samuel Randall, was married to Rebecca Atkins,
my wife`'s cousin, who proved an excellent wife to him until his death,
which increased our former attachment to each other.

In 1687, I went several times to England, and twice to Holland, on account of trade.
On one of these occasions, I accompanied our beloved Friend William Penn,
who went to the Yearly Meeting at Amsterdam, where we met Roger Haydock,
George Watts of London, and other Friends in the ministry.
Great numbers attended; amongst whom were several Englishmen of considerable note,
who fled from their country, having been suspected of, or charged with,
being concerned in a plot.
After the meeting was over, I left William Penn, who travelled through Germany,
and I returned home.

Though I have not said much of my concern for Truth, from the year 1681, to 1688,
yet through the Lord`'s mercy, I grew therein,
and according to my growth began to concern myself more and more in meetings for discipline.
Frequently going to England on business, I became acquainted with many faithful Friends,
and avoided, as much as I could, all libertine, airy company;
delighting in the society of solid and weighty Friends, whom I dearly loved,
and who loved me.
I often attended their meetings for discipline, and was also at some Yearly Meetings,
at such seasons.
I also visited George Fox at his lodgings in London,
whose conversation was very pleasant to me.
He was very open and free in discourse, about Friends and the affairs of Truth.
I wondered at his freedom, since I was but a young man,
and pretty much a stranger to him; but he had a discerning spirit, and I doubt not,
saw my sincerity.
He was a sweet-spirited, innocent man, yet very zealous for Truth,
and sharp against apostates, hypocrites, and libertines,
besides his other extraordinary qualifications.

I frequently attended our Half-year`'s meeting in Dublin;
the first time I went as representative, was in the year 1681.
Samuel Randall and I lodged at John Englefield`'s,
which place was kindly provided for us by our beloved Friend, John Burnyeat.
He was a Friend, beloved and esteemed as a father in Israel, which he was.
I had been well acquainted with him before this,
having travelled with him to many meetings, though I was but a young man.
To this account I may add,
I always had a great regard to the sense and judgment of faithful elders,
in or out of meetings;
and if at any time I did not see through the things they proposed or were for,
I was apt to question my own opinion, as believing,
their growth in the Truth was greater than mine; this, I found by experience,
was safest and of benefit to me, and will be for all young men; as the apostle commands,
"`Ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder--and be clothed with humility.`" 1 Peter 5:5.
"`Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves;
for they watch for your souls,`" etc. Heb. 13:17.
This plainly shows, that submission is due to the counsel of elders;
and those young men who despise or disregard the advice and admonition of godly elders,
are self-willed, and are in a dangerous state, unless they repent.

In the ninth month, 1688, the Prince of Orange, (afterwards king,) landed in England.
Some time after which, King James went into France, and soon came to Ireland.
He landed at Kinsale, in the first month following, with about six thousand French,
as was reported, and shortly after came up to Cork, where he remained about two weeks,
and then proceeded to Dublin, augmenting his army to a great number, intending,
as was said, to go to Scotland, and so into England, in order to recover his crown.
I shall not enter into a detail of the fights, sieges, burnings,
and other dismal consequences of war,
that attended this nation for two or three years afterwards,
but shall only touch a little upon them as occasion may require.

In the third month, 1690, several Friends of Cork went to the Half-year`'s meeting,
in Dublin, notwithstanding it was dangerous to travel,
by reason of the armies marching to and fro, and the plundering Rapparees,
who were numerous throughout the country, which made it very hazardous to venture,
yet these things did not deter us from going.
Amongst those who went, were my dear cousin, Samuel Randall, George Griffiths,
Richard Clemens, and myself.
Apprehending the great road the most dangerous, we took a round towards the sea,
by Youghal, Dungarvan, Waterford, Wexford, and Wicklow, to Dublin, where,
through the Lord`'s mercy, we arrived safe, though not without fear of being robbed,
and abused, if not killed by the way.

The towns we passed through, were pretty much filled with officers and soldiers,
so that we found it hard to get lodging or other accommodations.
I remember, particularly, stopping at George Wright`'s, who lived at Ballytruckle,
near Waterford, and whose house was taken up with the army,
so that we lay on straw in his barn, with which we were well contented,
being easy and cheerful in our minds.
Friends in Dublin were pleased to see us:
our dearly beloved friend John Burnyeat in particular,
expressed his gladness in the Half-year`'s meeting for business.
We had a very good season together, the Lord`'s presence attending us,
and we returned home the same way, to the joy and comfort of our friends and relations.

In the ninth month following, only my cousin Samuel, and brother Richard Pike,
went from Cork to the meeting, after which, the roads became so dangerous,
that none could safely travel, until the third month, 1692.

In the seventh month, 1690, Cork was besieged by the English: Lord Churchill,
afterwards Duke of Marlborough, commanded the siege,
M'`Gillicuddy being then the Irish governor of the city.
He was a rude boisterous man, and gave out that he intended to burn the suburbs;
upon which, the inhabitants, English and Irish, treated with him to save them,
and agreed to give him five hundred pounds in silver,
most of which was gathered and paid to him; yet I could not trust his word,
and removed the best of my goods, and thereby saved them.
Notwithstanding this, he afterwards burned both the north and south suburbs,
whereby not only the houses but much goods were destroyed.
The town was delivered up in a few days; and about four thousand, with the governor,
taken prisoners, some of whom were put into our meetinghouse,
so that Friends had to meet in another place.

During these dismal times, my family, and that of my cousin Samuel Randall,
lived together at a house in the North Abbey;
for after the change of the government into Irish hands, great numbers fled to England,
and the English who stayed behind, were often abused and confined;
two or three could hardly meet or speak together without danger,
so that they were in constant terror of their lives, remembering the massacre of 1641,
and at times fearing another.

And indeed at two particular times, myself with Friends were under apprehensions of it.
One was, when the Irish wholly disarmed the English of this city,
which they began in the evening near night,
by lining the streets with soldiers armed with lighted matches.
They kept the design private even from the Irish,
lest it might get wind and the English hide the arms they had left.
I remember a noted and intelligent Irishman came to my house, I then living in the town,
and in great consternation and in a trembling manner said to me, "`Lord!
Mr. Pike, what are they going to do?
I am afraid of mischief.`"
This from a man of their own sort, could not but raise apprehensions of danger in me;
but I turned my mind inward to the Lord,
and was pretty quiet in submission to the Lord`'s permissive will and providence.
Through all the night, however, they only searched English houses, and got some arms:
and thus this frightful circumstance passed over.

The other time was, when the English of Bandon revolted,
and turned out the Irish garrison; upon which an army of Irish, horse and foot,
gathered at Cork to reduce them; Justin M'`Carthy, afterwards Lord Mountcashel,
commanded them.
Before they went towards Bandon,
some of the soldiers or others laid a design to plunder the house of Richard Terry,
who lived out of the South Gate at the Red Abbey; and in order thereto,
got into the tower and made some shots from it,
then gave out that the English were gathering there, to rise with the Bandon people:
upon which abundance of Irish gathered, and a hideous noise there was;
and thereupon the designers plundered the house.
I remember that at the very time of this hurly-burly, my cousin Samuel Randall and I,
walking on the Custom-house quay, saw a multitude of people,
but knew not the cause of their assembling; and hastening into town,
we found the troopers riding violently along the streets with drawn swords,
the soldiers running to arms, the Irish in an uproar, crying out,
"`The Bandon people are come,
and killing thousands out of South Gate;`" others in confusion cried out,
"`Kill them all,
kill them all;`" and some looked wickedly upon us two with countenances full of mischief;
yet we got safely through them to my house.
During this time of confusion, many husbands left their families and houses,
and ran on board the first ship they could get, as did also many women and children,
believing the English would all be slain.
The ships sailing directly for England,
carried the news that all the English were murdered;
but in a little time this confusion ceased, when the true cause was known.

When this circumstance had blown over,
the general got ready in a day or two with his army to go against Bandon,
and many thousands of Rapparees gathered together, in hopes of plunder;
but when they had marched about seven miles towards the town,
mediators on both sides composed the matter with the general,
agreeing to pay a sum of money, and to deliver up the town and their arms;
and so the plunderers were sadly disappointed.

Now, to return to the siege of Cork.
Notwithstanding the governor had agreed to spare the suburbs, I could not trust his word,
and therefore removed much of the best of our goods to my house in town,
and so saved them, while many lost their all; for though notice was given,
before the suburbs were set on fire, yet the throng was then so great,
that we could not get into the town without danger,
and the Irish soldiers were very abusive.

The siege presently came on; for the governor would not surrender upon summons;
the paving of the streets was pulled up to deaden the bombs, of which there were,
I think, twelve or thirteen thrown into the town while the siege lasted.
The cannons from without roared,
and they made a breach in the wall on the east side towards South Gate.
The then Duke of Grafton commanded the marines,
and approached to Dunscombe Marsh over the river, intending to storm at the breach;
and in all human probability would have carried the town,
but that he was mortally wounded from the walls, and died in about a week.
This put a stop to their taking the city by storm, and the governor capitulated,
agreeing to deliver up the place, and themselves as prisoners of war, and their arms.
I am thus particular, in order to show,
that if an agreement had not taken place at that time,
Friends had been in imminent danger of their lives, without a miraculous preservation;
for all other Protestants were then shut up in prisons and houses, with guards over them,
and this the besiegers knew, but Friends were at liberty,
the Irish believing there was no danger from us;
so that if the town had been taken by storm, as it was on the point of being,
humanly speaking, we should have been slain with the Irish.
But the Lord`'s good hand of providence was over us for our preservation,
for which we were truly thankful to him.

When the town was delivered up, the prisoners computed at about 4,000,
were put into the places of worship,
so that Friends met in a back place belonging to Thomas Wight`'s house;
the weather being wet, the English soldiers as well as Irish prisoners, grew very sickly,
and great numbers died almost every day, and were buried in a large hole or pit.
The citizens were also infected, and very many died, and the city became like a hospital,
being in a dismal condition, for a long time.
At length many of the prisoners ran away, and others that remained were let go,
but the governor and chiefs were sent to the Tower of London.

The sickness continuing in the city for a considerable time, there was little trade,
and things were much disordered and unsettled in various parts of the nation;
my cousin S. Randall and myself, having been long under a sort of confinement,
found freedom in ourselves, with the assent of Friends,
to leave the city for a time for our refreshment.

I with my wife and son went to England,
and my cousin with his wife and child went by sea
to his father`'s in the county of Wexford.
I remained in and about Bristol for nearly twelve months,
attended the meetings for discipline pretty constantly,
and went to the following Yearly Meeting in London,
a concern increasing with me for the good order and government of the church of Christ.

When I had been about six months in England, I had great drawings of mind to return home;
not that I desired to leave so soon, but from a concern that grew weightily upon me,
for the discipline of Truth, until it became so heavy,
that I felt ashamed to be seen any longer there, though I kept it to myself,
yet I resolved to return as soon as I conveniently could.
We landed safely in Cork, in the third month, 1692; soon after which,
my cousin Samuel and family returned also, and he informed me,
that he had been under a similar concern, which was a confirmation to us,
that our hearts were prepared by the Lord,
and we were unitedly bound to serve Him all our days.

Thus I saw, in the Divine Light,
that I must join heart and hand with other faithful brethren,
in a reformation of many things that were creeping in amongst Friends in Ireland,
as they had done elsewhere, to the hurt of many.
This sight brought a heavy exercise upon me, and I often said in my heart,
"`Oh! that I could shelter myself under some worthy elders!
I would heartily assist them in spirit, and, as under their wings,
do what little I could:`" But it was very grievous to my mind,
to appear as one of the foremost; and I can truly say that, in all my concerns for Truth,
I never desired to lord it over God`'s heritage,
but prayed that I might be a good example to the flock in all things.
I was led by the Holy Spirit to be tender to all that were tender,
though they had missed it; but otherwise to the libertines, and to the stiff, stubborn,
and rebellious, or to such as opposed the godly order and discipline of the church.
I was sometimes concerned to be as a sharp, threshing instrument,
in the zeal of the Lord against such.

And this kind of dealing is no new thing; for we find in the Holy Scriptures,
that the prophets and apostles, were very many times, sharp in words to wicked men;
and we also read, that Christ himself was so against evil doers, calling them "`serpents,
hypocrites,`" and pronounced the woe against some of them,
even to his own beloved disciples, when they were not in a right spirit.
He said to Peter, "`Get thee behind me, Satan,`" and also said,
"`Oh! faithless and perverse generation!`" upbraiding
them with hardness of heart and unbelief.
And after him, his apostles were, as occasion offered, sharp in expression;
for although the apostle Paul advises in some cases, to make a difference,
so as to "`comfort the feeble-minded,`" and "`support the weak;`" yet,
he also directs to _rebuke sharply with all authority, and to warn the unruly, etc._
I say not this to justify any, in being angry, sharp, or severe in their own spirits,
or in the natural part; but true and warm zeal, kindled by the fire of the Lord,
and attended with knowledge, are acceptable to him,
as I could show by many instances from Scripture; and indeed,
I never saw any who wanted right zeal for Truth,
of any great service in the churches of Christ.

In the ninth month after my arrival,
I went with my dear cousin Samuel Randall and other Friends to our Half-year`'s Meeting,
which we almost constantly attended, winter and summer,
for nearly twenty years afterwards;
and we heartily joined with faithful brethren in the service of Truth,
according to ability.
On one occasion, being written for by Friends in Dublin,
to come and assist them in soliciting against a bill in parliament,
that was likely very much to affect the Society,
I gave up to go in a great cross to my own mind;
for my son Samuel lay apparently at death`'s door,
and few that saw him thought he would live.
Though I loved him very dearly, yet I resigned him to the Lord,
and soon after I was gone, he began to mend a little; but was again brought so low,
that at my return from Dublin, about six weeks after, I found him but weak,
yet received him with great thankfulness, as a gift from the Lord,
and I pray that he may serve him in faithfulness to the end of his days.
I write this purely for the stirring up and encouragement of all,
to resign themselves to the service of Truth, and not to let small matters,
or even great ones in appearance, hinder them from their duty,
and from doing their day`'s work in their day.
For I loved the child so dearly,
that I really believe I would not have left him in that weak condition,
except as I then did, in the discharge of what I thought it my duty to do.

But to proceed.
We likewise went round this Province, with other brethren,
visiting Friends in their families, and in meetings appointed on purpose,
in which we had, so far as appeared to us, good service, and felt satisfaction;
for the Lord strengthened us, owning our labours of love, by his holy presence.
I also attended the Yearly Meeting in London eight times, from the year 1694 to 1715,
since which I have not been able to go thither.

This I can now say, with great humility, that while I had strength of body,
I did not spare pains to travel in the service of Truth,
according to my station in the church, and the ability given me of the Lord;
and I have great satisfaction of mind therein: whereas, if in looking back,
my conscience accused me of neglect, it would be now an unspeakable trouble to me,
when I am unable in body.
And I can in humble reverence appeal to the Searcher of hearts,
that I write not this to value myself for what little I have done in my day,
which is indeed but little; for I was, and still am an unprofitable servant,
and have nothing to glory in, save my infirmities.
But I write it for the encouragement of the honest-hearted,
that they may give themselves up to serve the Lord, his Truth, and people, in their day;
for if they delay until old age, when ability fails them, if they are honest-minded,
they will look back with great sorrow for their negligence.
And I will add, that though I spent a great deal of time in my travels and voyages,
and my charges therein were considerable,
yet I never to this day thought any thing of my time, my trouble, or my charges,
for I always believed that the Lord gave me substance to serve him withal.
I can in truth say, that I never spent any money in my life more freely,
or with more delight and satisfaction,
than what I did to serve Truth and the necessities of the Lord`'s people;
and this is the duty of all those upon whom is bestowed this world`'s substance;
and when I have at any time observed men of ability in this respect, narrow-spirited,
