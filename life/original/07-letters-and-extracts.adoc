Cork, 2nd of Tenth month, 1702.

[.salutation]
My dear aunt,

Though I have not written to thee, as I remember, since I saw thee, yet I can say,
I have very often remembered thee with endeared love,
which neither time nor distance of place can separate or wear out;
in which love do I at this time dearly salute thee, breathing to the Lord,
that his life and peace may more and more overflow and abound in thee.
And though it be most earnestly desired by the poor travelling soul,
always to dwell with the Lord, and +++[+++sensibly]
under the sweet influences of life, yet the Lord sees it not fit it should be so.
No doubt it was very desirable to the disciples in the Mount, who said,
"`It is good for us to be here,`" yet it was not to be so;
they were to come down from thence, and after this to endure temptations and afflictions.

Thus the Lord hath been pleased,
and it is the way of his dealing with his truly begotten sons and daughters,
to bring them through the fire and furnace of afflictions,
in order to sanctify and purify them throughout,
that their bodies may be made fit temples for himself to dwell in:
and thus we gain experience, patience, knowledge, and in times of deep temptation,
when the enemy is permitted to come in like a flood, learn to stand still,
until the Lord is pleased to arise for our deliverance,
which certainly comes in his appointed time.

My dear aunt, my heart is full of love, and much is in my mind,
but I desire rather to be felt by thee, in that which is beyond words,
than to enlarge in too much writing.

To John Fallowfield

[.signed-section-context-open]
Cork, 19th of First month, 1710.

[.salutation]
Dear friend, John Fallowfield,

Feeling a sweetness and openness, I send this with the salutation of endeared love,
in which I have often remembered thee,
not forgetting those tender and greatly refreshing
seasons the Lord was pleased to favour us with,
when thou wast in these parts.

Oh that the unutterable lovingkindness and tender mercies of our
most gracious Lord God may never slip out of our remembrance;
but that while we have a day to live in this world,
we may walk in all humility and thankfulness before him,
that so at the close of our days,
we may receive the recompense and reward laid up for the righteous; for oh!
I very often consider, it is the end which crowns all.
It is not running well for a season that will do,
but holding out and enduring to the end,
which will give us an entrance into God`'s everlasting kingdom.

We know what is past, but know not what is to come:
many have no doubt been rightly called in the morning of the day, had excellent gifts,
and were then as morning stars, shone beautifully,
and were very zealous and serviceable for a time; and yet,
alas! not to mention some who fell away through divers temptations,
we see some of those who are now grey headed,
still retaining the form and profession of Truth,
and can perhaps speak much of things as in the beginning, and of their services,
yet are now grown cold or lukewarm in spirit,
and rather open a door than shut it against that liberty the Truth will not allow of.
What or where is the cause?
Is it in the Lord or his holy Spirit?
Surely no.
Truth is as lively as ever, and will so continue in old age,
to those who sincerely love and follow the Lord.
The fault then is in man: the want of inward waiting and watchfulness,
is no doubt the occasion; and therefore it is,
particularly under the consideration of such as these,
that I have often cried unto the Lord for preservation to the end;
and that if I lived to old age, I might not grow like unto them.

And as I thus desire for myself, so I can truly say I have often done for thee.
I am satisfied the Lord has called thee into, and gifted thee for his service,
and that his love and kindness is toward thee; and the desire and cry of thy soul is,
that thou mayst be preserved, to serve Him in thy day.
Perseverance then, and waiting in that gift which the Lord has given thee and me,
is the way and means for our preservation to the end,
to give us an inheritance among them that are sanctified in God`'s kingdom;
and that thus it may be with us both, and all the Lord`'s people,
is the very desire of my soul.
Amen.

To the Same

[.signed-section-context-open]
Cork, 28th of First month, 1711.

[.salutation]
Dear friend, John Fallowfield,

I send this with the salutation of dear love,
even that love in which all those that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity,
are near and dear one unto another;
and in which love thou hast been often in my remembrance,
with desires to the Lord of all our mercies, for thy growth and preservation,
with my own, in his holy and blessed Truth.
For this we both know, the fault will lie on our side if we are not preserved.
I well know thou hast no need of instruction from me,
having a better Instructor so near thee, the Lord Jesus in thy own soul,
by a measure and manifestation of his holy Spirit;
and yet the love of him who hath loved us,
does sometimes constrain us in that love to put one another
in remembrance of what we know to be our duty.
And thus I recommend to thee, what I often do to my own soul, namely,
more and more inwardness and waiting upon the Lord: here it is, being upon our watch,
that we see the enemy of our souls in all his approaches,
and seeing him and flying to the Lord for assistance, we are made able to withstand him.
Here also we are ready to hear what our blessed Lord will communicate to us;
and thus being inward with him and waiting upon him,
we shall assuredly know a growth and progress in his holy Truth.
But oh! for want of more inwardness, and by neglecting the watch,
I verily believe many have suffered loss, who once knew good things;
and that it may not be so with either of us, is the very desire of my soul.

[.letter-heading]
To Henry Gouldney

[.signed-section-context-open]
Cork, 10th of Ninth month, 1712.

[.salutation]
Dear friend, Henry Gouldney,

Having taken notice of the chief contents of thine,
and now in writing feeling my spirit open unto thee in the ancient love,
in which we were at first made near and dear to one another in spirit,
I send this with the salutation thereof;
which love is as fresh with me as at the beginning,
and I doubt not but will continue so to the end between us,
as we abide in that which is the fountain and spring of true love, namely,
the Lord`'s holy and blessed Truth.
And oh! that we may grow therein,
to the end of those few days we may have yet to live in this fading and perishing world,
is the very desire of my soul.

For surely we have the greater reason to be fearful of ourselves,
and cry unto the Lord for preservation, while we have had, and still have,
so many examples of those who once were tender and
zealous for the Lord`'s holy name and Truth,
who, by giving way to a careless, negligent, and unwatchful spirit,
have run into a false liberty,
and can now indulge themselves and others in those
very things that once they were zealous against;
which is a plain demonstration that such have lost their first love,
and have forgotten the day of their espousals to the Lord.

But oh! may it never be so either with thee or any of the Lord`'s people,
who yet retain in measure their sincerity unto him.
Let then the harms and falls of others be as warnings to us, to keep near the Lord,
who will assuredly keep and preserve to the end, if it be not our fault.
In order to which, let us dear friend keep continually upon our watch;
be more and more inward to the Lord; for surely inwardness, inwardness,
is too much wanting among the Lord`'s people.
Had we ourselves been less outward in our minds, and more inward to the Lord,
we had known more of his blessed Truth than we do at this day and therefore,
oh! that during the few days we may yet have to spend,
we may pray continually that the Lord might be pleased to stay our minds upon Him.

To James Hoskins

[.signed-section-context-open]
Cork, 23rd of Ninth month, 1712.

[.salutation]
Dear friend,

I observe what thou writest in relation to the admittance
of members into meetings for discipline.
I am of the same mind with thee respecting your nation,
as well as what may happen in ours; and I do think,
that Friends everywhere ought to be sensible, without the least respect of persons,
that such who are admitted ought, in measure,
as well to have a concern upon their minds for the Lord`'s service,
as to be honestly inclined respecting their own souls.

[.letter-heading]
To John Wright

[.signed-section-context-open]
Cork, 21st of Twelfth month, 1712.

[.salutation]
Dear friend, John Wright,

In that love which reaches over sea and land, do we at this time dearly remember thee,
even that love which joins and cements those who
love our Lord Jesus Christ and his testimony,
making them as bone of one another`'s bone and flesh
of one another`'s flesh in a spiritual sense.
The desire of our souls is, that this love may continue between us,
in which we may remember one another while we remain in this lower region;
and not only between us,
but that it might also dwell with and be maintained among all the Lord`'s people everywhere,
which would be a mark to the world of true discipleship.

But oh! with great lamentation it may be said, that instead thereof,
the love of this present world, and its interests,
hath prevailed upon too many of those who are so called,
while they have preferred it to the love of the brethren,
and the peace and unity of the church; and rather than part with or decline the first,
they will sacrifice the last.
All which is but too evident among those in whom
the seed of life and testimony of Jesus are suffering;
while, as we are informed,
they seem to have no regard to their tender conscientious brethren,
but have already carried and seem resolved to carry
things with a high hand over the heads of their brethren;
of all which no doubt thou hast heard.
Yet the outrageous doings of such,
ought not to slacken the hands of those who are truly
concerned for the testimony of Truth;
but in Truth`'s way, and in the meek Spirit of Jesus,
they should stand their ground and do what they can; and having so done,
leave the issue to the Lord, who in his own time will arise and plead his own cause,
and appear for those who bear a faithful testimony for his sacred name,
which hath been greatly trampled upon by loose libertine spirits.

It is indeed a time of great suffering in spirit,
to those who are truly concerned for the prosperity of Zion, while the enemies thereof,
yet pretended friends to her, do so greatly prevail.
What shall the mourners in Zion on this occasion do, but travail with the oppressed,
and cry unto the Lord, that he will be pleased to look down in pity,
and relieve the bowed down, and distressed in spirit,
who mourn and lament for the deplorable state of the church,
in many places too much governed and overruled by pretended elders and a libertine party.

[.letter-heading]
To Mary Beale

[.signed-section-context-open]
Cork, Twelfth month, 1712.

[.salutation]
My dear sister, Mary Beale,

In relation to members of men`'s and women`'s meetings, I think I am not,
and I hope shall not be, partial even for my own children.
I must needs say upon judgment, that I think none can or will help the church,
but such as are in some measure sensible members, at least they that have an honest,
solid bottom, and are subject to the advice and counsel of Friends.
If, on the contrary, there is height or stiffness, either in men or women,
I must say that I think the admittance of such will
rather do the church and themselves hurt than good.

[.letter-heading]
To James Wilson

[.signed-section-context-open]
Cork, 26th of First month, 1714.

[.salutation]
Dear friend, James Wilson,

I believe with thee,
that there will be need enough of many more right-spirited
men at the Yearly Meeting than perhaps may go there;
not that I expect they can do much good at this time by promoting
good discipline and good order in the churches of Christ;
but rather, if it be possible, stand in the gap, and oppose what some loose,
libertine spirits would introduce into the churches of Christ.
The consideration, that such should have any hand in the government of the churches,
hath often wounded my spirit: the Lord, if it be his blessed will, put a stop thereto,
and raise up and increase the number of faithful, clean spirited men,
truly sanctified in soul, body, and spirit,
who may stand as bulwarks against that spirit and flood of liberty and ungodliness,
which hath made too large a progress in some of the churches of Christ at this day.

And what is very grievous to consider, is, that some would be accounted as elders,
who do greatly strengthen the hands of such libertines,
even such as I believe were at first rightly called into the Lord`'s service,
and in the beginning were truly zealous,
and rightly concerned for the promotion of Truth,
but have now in old age grown lukewarm or cold,
having lost their first love and zeal for the Lord and his Truth.
This is indeed lamentable to consider,
and such are examples of warning to us to take heed to ourselves, pointing out to us,
that it is not running well for a season,
but holding out to the end that gains the crown;
for if such had kept to Truth in themselves,
they would have been as fruitful in old age as in youth.
The fault then is on man`'s part, for want of keeping upon their watch;
perhaps at first letting in small things; and though seemingly indifferent,
yet these have had an evil tendency in the end, too easily sliding into their minds,
by which a veil in some degree came over their hearts and understandings,
and thus they became more readily drawn into greater and grosser things,
to the defilement thereof,
until they had at last wholly lost their first love and zeal for the Lord.

Oh! saith my soul, that we who have been made sensible of these things,
may stand upon our watch, keep our ground,
give not way to the enemy in the least appearance,
or what may have a tendency to evil or the hurt of our minds.
Watching continually unto prayer, is the way of preservation;
and therefore our Lord commanded his disciples to do so,
lest they should enter into temptation.
My heart is at this time open to thee, dear James, in much love,
with desire in my soul for thy preservation every way, with my own,
that in the end we may obtain the crown,
and receive the recompense of reward laid up for the righteous.
Amen.

[.letter-heading]
To Margaret Hoare

[.signed-section-context-open]
Cork, 23rd of First month, 1714.

[.salutation]
My dear sister,

Our God is love, and as saith the apostle, they who dwell in him, dwell in love;
even in that love which is pure and undefiled,
wherein they can sympathize with one another, either in rejoicing in the Lord,
or in afflictions which he may be pleased to permit to come upon them,
for the trial of their faith and patience.
But, O! my dear sister! though a stability and settlement in the holy Truth is attainable,
wherein this love is continually upheld and maintained,
yet we know it is a very great and high attainment,
and is come at only through the power of the cross and a dying to ourselves,
to all things which are contrary to, or grieve the good Spirit of our Lord Jesus.
This high estate is what David prayed for, namely,
to dwell in the house of the Lord forever, which is to be as stakes in Zion,
and pillars in the house of God which go no more forth; and as Paul witnessed,
to be made free from the law of sin and death.

Happy, O forever happy will all they be, who attain to, and continue in,
this blessed state in Christ!
But many were the strugglings, trials, temptations,
and deep afflictions of the righteous formerly, and they are the same in this day,
before they arrive at this condition.
David said in his prosperity, he should never be moved: Peter thought,
no doubt as he said, he would never deny his Lord,
and when he and John were in the Mount with Christ, no doubt he was of the same mind.
And Paul, when he was caught up into the third heaven,
I believe little thought he should afterwards cry out of a body of sin and death: again,
David could in the Lord`'s power run through a troop, leap over a wall, slay the lion,
the bear, and the Philistine.
Many other instances might be given, what holy men of old could do,
and what holy resolutions they had, when the power of Truth was uppermost in them;
and yet,
after they had been thus favoured with such extraordinary times of God`'s love and favour,
how they were tempted, tried, and buffeted by Satan,
and what complaints they made thereof, from the very bitterness of their souls.

As it was thus with them of old, so it is yet with the righteous in our day.
When the Lord, our gracious and merciful God,
is pleased to lift up the light of his countenance upon them,
and to give them extraordinary times of his love and favour; then, oh! then,
they are apt to think they shall never be moved again; then are they willing, yea,
very willing, to run the ways of the Lord`'s commandments;
hoping they shall never more be troubled with the same temptings,
they have formerly been afflicted with.
And yet again, after this, when life is withdrawn,
when the Lord is pleased to hide his face a little, and they are left to themselves;
notwithstanding they may have been so highly favoured,
and have had such extraordinary times before, how are they cast down,
how are they afflicted, how do they cry out and mourn before the Lord,
by reason of the buffetings of Satan, even such as they were troubled with before,
and from which they hoped they had been delivered.
These are indeed times of great proving, and distress of spirit.
What are we to do in this condition, but stand as still as possible,
out of our own thoughts, out of our own willings and reasonings,
not so much as to look at the temptation, but have our eye wholly to the Lord,
who hath so often delivered us, as he did his servants of old,
out of our greatest distress.
And yet, oh! how forgetful we are, that even at such times of exercise as these,
we cannot sensibly remember, so as livingly to believe, he will deliver us again,
but are too apt to make a judgment of our present desertion and distress of spirit.

[.letter-heading]
To Abigail Craven, Afterwards Watson

[.signed-section-context-open]
Cork, 26th of Third month, 1717.

[.salutation]
Dear Abigail,

I herewith send thee the salutation of my dear love, as unto one whom I truly love,
and whose welfare and prosperity I truly desire every way, but in a more especial manner,
thy growth and prosperity in the Lord`'s eternal Truth; and that as he hath, I believe,
given thee a gift for the ministry,
and committed a dispensation of the Gospel to thy charge; so on thy part,
thou mayst answer the Lord`'s love in the right discharge thereof, neither going before,
nor staying behind.

Dear friend, do not think I am going about to charge or condemn thee,
it is far from my mind to do it.
But in the very love of my heart I write,
as having in my time seen the great damage and loss of some, who,
notwithstanding they were rightly called, and gifted for the ministry,
have greatly missed their way, and by too much forwardness, and too soon going into long,
large, and doctrinal testimonies, hoping or desiring to do service for the Lord,
have instead thereof marred the service which they would have had,
if they had solidly waited in the measure of the gift given them,
that so the true fire of the Lord might have accompanied their offerings,
and thereby made their services acceptable.
Such as these, I have seen in the end to come to so great a loss,
as not to know their right time, when to begin, or when to end,
and have thereby lost that service in the ministry,
for the edification and comfort of the churches, which otherwise they would have had;
as also, instead of rendering them acceptable through their service,
it has had the contrary effect, they being disesteemed and slighted.
Whereas they who have truly kept in and to their gift, and ministered therefrom,
though at times very short in declaration, stopping in due season,
as Israel was to do in the wilderness; what these have had to say, has hit the mark,
had its due service, and been like apples of gold in pictures of silver.

Another thing, dear friend, and which I say to you both, is,
that you well know the eyes of those where you come will be upon you,
some perhaps for evil, as well as some for good;
and therefore it will concern you to be very solid and circumspect
in your appearance and conversation wherever you come,
and not to misuse that innocent, open freedom, which in the Truth you might have or take;
remembering what the apostle saith,
"`All things are lawful but not convenient;`" that even the very freedom,
which Truth does not disallow, may not be convenient to take or use in many places,
or indeed but in a few.

[.letter-heading]
To Joseph Gurney

[.signed-section-context-open]
Cork, Sixth month, 1717.

[.salutation]
Dear friend,

It hath been very often upon my mind since thy departure, to visit thee with a few lines,
to communicate such things as might in the love of God occur to my mind;
and feeling the concern renewed at this time,
I herewith in the first place send the salutation of very dear love in the holy Truth,
wherewith I love thee, and in which I can truly say I desire thy prosperity every way,
but in a more especial manner thy growth and prosperity
in the Lord`'s holy and eternal Truth.
And as he has, I am satisfied, given thee a gift for the ministry,
so on thy part thou mayst answer his love,
by thy obedience in giving thyself up to whatsoever he may be pleased to require of thee,
neither staying behind, nor going before, but waiting in the pure light,
in which thou wilt truly see thy way,
and by which alone the things of God`'s kingdom are made known and manifested,
as well what may relate to ourselves,
as what he may require of us to communicate to others
according to our several stations in the church.

But oh! for want of true waiting in his pure light,
and being continually inward to the Lord,
I have seen in my time many who have been rightly called and gifted,
who have come to a loss; and at last, some of them have lost their way to that degree,
as not to know their right time either when to go abroad, or when to stay at home,
or when to begin in testimony, or when to end; by which the service they would have had,
if they had truly kept to the light and walked therein, has been marred.
And yet perhaps, some of these have retained the form of sound words,
and could speak notably too; but for want of being inward enough,
and keeping their eye single to the Lord in his gift,
whereby their bodies would have been full of light,
and whereby they would have seen times, seasons,
and things respecting either themselves or others,--I say, for want thereof,
some have come to such a loss and decay, and have grown so dark, as to go or stay,
speak or not speak, in their own time, and not in the Lord`'s;
which has been cause of sorrow and lamentation to
those who have kept their habitations in the light,
and therein have seen the loss some such have sustained,
and all for want of inward watchfulness and walking in the light.

I write not these things, dear friend, by way of application to thee,
or to discourage thee in thy service, far from it, but in the love of God,
which I feel in my heart towards thee, to encourage thee to keep in thy gift;
minister therefrom, neither going before, nor staying behind,
that the Holy Spirit of Jesus may be thy guide in all things,
and that the harms of others by not keeping to and walking in the light,
may be our warning; remembering also, what our blessed Lord said to his disciples,
"`Without me, ye can do nothing.`"
All our strength and ability, then, is in him;
and this strength and ability is received from him,
by our inward waiting upon him in the gift of his holy Spirit.
There it is, that we see our own unworthiness, and ourselves truly as we are;
there it is,
that we persevere and go on from one degree of strength and grace unto another;
there it is we see what the Lord requires of us, either respecting ourselves or others;
and there it is also,
we see the enemy of our souls in all his appearances and transformations,
and are made able by the Lord`'s strength to withstand him in all his temptations.

But oh! this inwardness, this inwardness,
has been and is too much wanting amongst the Lord`'s people, even among many preachers,
as well as hearers, whom the Lord in the beginning highly favoured; who,
had they continued as inward as the Lord would have had them to be,
would have been more eminently serviceable in the church in their day,
and attained to a more extraordinary degree of heavenly brightness,
and have witnessed more excellent discoveries of the divine
mysteries of God`'s kingdom than they have done.
And out of this number I will not exclude myself;
well knowing had I been more inward than I have been,
my growth in his holy Truth had been greater than it is.
Yet in great humility, I bless his holy name, that I can say,
I desire with my whole soul, that for the residue of these few days I may have to spend,
and I expect them to be but a few, I may be continually inward to him.
And as this is, I think, the best wish I can wish for myself,
respecting my duty to Him who lives forever, so, dear friend,
I can also say I truly desire the same for thee.

And now, my dear friend,
as I have hitherto written more chiefly relating
to inwardness and the work of the Holy Spirit within,
it is in my mind also to write something of the effects of the same Spirit,
and to what it leads outwardly, respecting our conversation, etc. in the world;
in which I can, through the great mercy and goodness of my God,
mention something of my own certain experience.
I was young, and now I am old,
at least well stricken in years,--my dear and blessed Lord was
mercifully pleased to reach unto and visit my soul in my young
days,--and it was the day of my first love and espousals to him,
which I shall never forget while I continue in his love.
O the brokenness and tenderness of spirit that was upon my soul in that day!
How I loved the Lord, his Truth, and faithful people!
O the zeal, that was in my soul for him!
The tender concern that was on my spirit,
that I might not grieve or offend him in anything,
and that I might not do anything against the Truth, but all the little I could for it!
My soul remembers these things at this instant,
the sense thereof being renewed upon my spirit,
in great humility and thankfulness to the Lord.
Then was I fearful and careful how I did eat, how I did drink,
how I was clothed in plainness of apparel, what I spake, how I spake,
and that my words might be few and savoury; what company I kept, and what fear was I in,
lest I might be hurt with the company and conversation of
the world! for I found by keeping their company unnecessarily,
and with delight, it was like pitch which defileth.
The blessed light of my dear Lord did in that day let me see these things,
with many more, needless to enumerate, that would be hurtful to me if I delighted in,
or used them to please or gratify a carnal mind out of the cross of Christ.

But if I should be asked in old age, "`How is it with thee?
hast thou not since found, there is more liberty in the Truth than in that day,
which by thy own account was a time of childhood or youth?
Dost thou not now find thou wast then over nice and tender,
and more fearful and careful than Truth did really require, as not having had time,
and experience, nor yet judgment to discern between things?`"
I say, if I should thus be asked, I could answer in much sincerity, thus:
Since my childhood, I have no doubt witnessed various states and conditions,
and in humility and with great thankfulness can say,
my time has afforded me larger experience,
and a greater growth in the Lord`'s holy Truth, than in that day.
But yet this I testify for the Lord, which I have found by my own experience,
that what the holy Truth led me into in that day, and let me see when I was young,
it leads me into the same now in my old age.
Truth is the same as it was in the beginning; it changeth not, neither does it wax old:
and if any find a decay, or in other words,
think it gives more liberty than in the beginning, I can testify from my own experience,
that liberty is not of or from the Lord, but is of and from man,
who is departed in measure more or less from the Lord.

Truth, I say again, waxes not old, though the body may grow weaker and weaker,
and may outwardly decay, yet those who keep to the Truth in old age,
grow stronger and stronger in the Lord, and in the power of his might;
their zeal waxes not old nor cold.
They find, that though the truth gives the liberty to eat and drink in moderation,
and with a due regard to that hand from whence it comes,
yet it gives no more liberty than in the beginning, to eat and drink,
to please and gratify a voluptuous mind.
Their tongues are no more their own, than in the beginning;
Truth then required our words to be few and savoury, and it doth the very same now.
Truth gives no more liberty in wearing fine or gay
apparel to please a vain or curious mind;
it led into plainness then, and it doth the very same now;
it then led out of company-keeping with the world
and frequenting ale-houses and taverns unnecessarily,
it doth the very same now, with many more things I could enumerate.
These things have been my experience both in youth and old age;
and if any shall plead or argue for other things,
and that Truth doth now give a greater latitude and liberty than in the beginning,
I can declare and testify for the Lord, and from my own experience,
that I have never found any such liberty in the Truth.

As I have at first written of the inward work of the Holy Spirit,
and next what it leads to outwardly, as to conversation, etc.,
it is further upon my mind to add a little more relating to outward means,
which the Lord in his wisdom has also seen meet to afford his people,
as conducive to their good and to the great end of their salvation;
in which I shall be as brief as I can, and therefore will begin with preaching.

As saith the apostle, by the foolishness of preaching,
it pleased the Lord to save those that believe.
Here, preaching by the Holy Ghost, is a means to salvation.
Well then the true preachers ministering from the Holy Spirit, are,
as we know oftentimes, led to declare and warn the Lord`'s people against pride,
covetousness, and eagerly pursuing the world to the hurt of their souls,
against the finery and vanity of apparel, against drunkenness and evil company,
against loose walking and conversation.
These things, with abundance more such like,
the Holy Spirit by the true ministers of Christ strikes at and testifies against,
as contrary to the Lord and the dictates of his Holy Spirit within,
as well as greatly hurtful to such as give way to them.
And as the Holy Spirit strikes at these things in public ministry,
so also doth the same Spirit in all true members of the church of Christ in discipline.
Thus it appears very plain to me,
that true discipline is but true preaching put in practice, and as under the law,
a Jew was not to suffer sin upon his brother without reproof, so,
much more under the Gospel.

When the ministry has not proved effectual to reclaim disorderly walkers,
or such who use lawful things unlawfully, or to their hurt; the overseers of the flock,
whom Christ hath made so, and who have first taken heed to themselves,
and being gifted for discipline by the same Spirit
that those in the ministry are for preaching,
seeing hurt and damage likely to attend any of the flock, are constrained in spirit,
in the love of God, and cannot but advise, exhort and admonish, or reprove such,
according to the nature of their case,
and bring things particularly to the person,--Thou art the man or woman who wears this,
does this or the other thing, that the Spirit of Truth led out of in the beginning,
and the same spirit testifies against now, through the true ministers of Christ.

This dealing with particulars,
I have oftentimes seen to be of great advantage and help to such as have been honest-hearted,
though in some respects they may have missed it.
But the libertines can scarcely bear or endure this sort of plain dealing,--they never
love it while in that spirit,--they must and will be left to their liberty and freedom,
so it be not-evil, as they call it;--they tell us,
they see no hurt or damage to Truth or themselves in wearing this,
or the other fine or fashionable thing,--they see
no hurt in keeping company with the world`'s people,
though they have no immediate business at ale-houses or taverns,
so they be not overcome with drink; no hurt in exercising their talents, wits, or parts,
provided they do not speak anything that is wicked.
Nay, some have said, they have served Truth in such company,
in being able to vindicate the principles of Truth, and putting to silence opposers,
with more such like things.
They will further tell us, they have a measure of the same spirit,
by which they have freedom to do these things and a great many more,
which those who truly walk in the light see are contrary to it,
and hurtful to themselves, and that their pretended freedom and liberty is but bondage.

Dear friend, I am ready to stop myself from writing after this manner.
I confess I have run on in this strain far beyond my expectation,
as well as that I verily believe I have no need at
all to write these things for thy conviction,
having not observed the least tendency in thee, in my small acquaintance with thee,
to any undue liberty.
For what reason I write thus, I hardly know,
but as these things came pretty swiftly into my mind, I let them go;
if they are of no service, yet I am not conscious of any hurt they can do;
if they but help to stir up thy pure mind by way of remembrance, my end will be answered.
And let it be as it will, place them, I desire thee,
to the abundance of love I feel flowing in my soul towards thee at this time,
with desires that the Lord may make thee as a bright and shining star in thy day,
to give light to his people.
The way thereto thou knowest, which I have hinted, as in the beginning,
is by being truly inward unto the Lord.
Oh!
I cannot but hint it again,--here is thy strong tower and defence to retire unto,
whether it be from the enemy within, or the strongest opposers without.
Keeping here thou wilt get the victory,
and stand in the dominion of Truth over all opposition both from within and without.
That this may be thy lot here, and an eternal portion of glory hereafter,
is the desire of my soul.

To John Haman, at George Chalkley`'s, Near London

[.signed-section-context-open]
Cork, 11th of Fifth month, 1718.

Dear friend,
I have at several times had it upon my mind to write thee since the decease of thy father,
in order to communicate such advice and counsel as might come upon my mind for thy good;
and having this opportunity by my son Francis, was willing to embrace it.
And in writing, I can assure thee that I have truly no other end therein but thy good,
neither do I know of any other I can have,
for I neither want nor desire anything thou shalt have, but thee to the Lord.
My concern is for thy preservation and growth in the Lord`'s holy and eternal Truth,
and that as thou growest in years, thou mayest grow in grace and in the fear of the Lord,
and then consequently thou wilt grow in his favour, as also in favour with his people.
I would have thee consider,
how excellent and comely a thing it is to see a lad
or young man dedicate his youthful days to the Lord,
and be adorned with his fear, which will lead into great humility, and into a sober,
godly behaviour and conversation.
This is very acceptable and well-pleasing to the Lord;
and such a young man or lad will assuredly meet with his blessing.

Now, dear child, in order to thy fearing the Lord, and consequently attaining his favour;
I do in the first place advise and earnestly recommend
thee to the gift and measure of his holy Spirit,
which he has given thee and placed in thy heart.
This is that which checks and reproves thee,
when at any time thou dost any thing thou oughtst not to do, or art airy, light,
or wanton, or dost give way in thyself to any evil thoughts or contrivances,
which may arise in thy mind.--I say, this holy Spirit of the Lord,
when thou art still and quiet in mind,
will bring judgment and trouble upon thee for so doing, or so giving way.
Therefore I do in the first place recommend thee to this gift, and thy obedience to it,
as that which will lead thee to love, fear, and obey the Lord.

In the next place, as thou art obedient to this holy gift in thyself,
thou wilt love the Lord`'s people,
and greatly delight to be in their company and have their conversation,
as well as be ready to take their advice and counsel for thy good; and on the contrary,
thou wilt not love nor delight in the company and conversation
of such as will endeavour to draw thee into pride,
vanity, or wantonness, or looseness in conversation, but wilt shun and avoid them,
though they may be even such as are comers to meetings;--there
are too many such among Friends,
which is matter of lamentation.

Another thing I particularly recommend to thee,
and which I desire thou wilt always remember;
and that is whenever thou meetest with any who may
be ready to fawn upon thee and smooth thee up,
and who may tell thee that thou hast an estate, and ought therefore, according to it,
to take thy liberty, having no father or mother to controul thee,
and so mayst do this or the other thing agreeable to one under thy circumstances;
in a word, such as would either incite or invite, or prompt thee,
to anything either in word or deed that has any tendency to pride, height, finery,
vanity, liberty, wantonness,--Mark such a person, whether young or old,
whether man or woman, and look upon him as thy utter enemy, and not thy friend,
though he may at the same time pretend love and respect to thee;
shun and avoid their company, having no conversation with such.

On the other hand, hearken to and take the advice and counsel of such as fear the Lord,
and deal plainly with thee, advising thee to humility, lowliness of mind,
and self-denial, agreeable to the command of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ,
who said, "`Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart,
and ye shall find rest unto your souls.`"
Such only are his true followers who so learn of him, while he beholds the proud,
the vain, the high-minded, the rebellious afar off;
and such are to have their portion and reward in
the lake that burns forever and forevermore.
Again, our Lord said, "`What shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world,
and lose his own soul?`"
so that if a man had millions of gold and silver, and lived not in the fear of the Lord,
which only entitles either younger or older to die in his favour,
his riches in a dying hour will be so far from being his comfort and satisfaction,
that even the thoughts of them will but add to his vexation and torment,
because by the ill use of them, and being high and proud, and valuing himself upon them,
they have thereby helped to make him worse, than perhaps he would have been,
had he not had them.

But, dear child, I hope better things of thee, than that thou wilt either be proud,
or value thyself upon what thou mayst have.
If thou shouldst, the Lord will be displeased and angry with thee,
and it is in his power to cut the thread of thy life,
before ever thou comest to enjoy them.
These few things in much love, and as a faithful friend,
I have on the one hand advised thee what I think best,
and on the other warned thee of what may be for thy hurt,
whether I ever live to see thee or not.

18th of Twelfth month, 1717.

I think I do daily see more and more need to cry out with thee, O! this inwardness,
this inwardness, is what has been too much wanting in a general way,
and is still wanting.
For it seems to me,
that many are in the high road to ruin for want of this true inward waiting
to know the Spirit of Truth to leaven and subdue their own spirits,
and also to open in them such things as might be
serviceable and beneficial in the churches of Christ,
both with respect to doctrine and discipline.
And I may tell thee,
as one who is not a stranger to the state of the ministry amongst us in this great,
and I had almost said, ungrateful city, that a living ministry is almost lost amongst us;
for here is so much working and studying of the flesh,
and that so well liked and embraced by many,
that the work of the Spirit and motions thereof are very much stopped,
even in such as dwell daily under the baptizings thereof.
It is but a few in comparison,
who have an ear open to hear what the Spirit doth say to the churches;
but when the Spirit doth speak through any, O how do they kick,
and even make a mock at it, and at such as are led and guided by the dictates thereof.
So that things are in a lamentable condition,
and it seems to me the true church is returning into the wilderness again,
where she sits solitary and mournful.
Yet the Lord sees her in her disconsolate state; and my faith is firm,
that the time will come, in which he will bring her back,
and she shall be seen to lean upon the breast of her beloved;
for in him is all her hope and trust.

Many who once were members of her, have forsaken the Lord,
and trusted to and leaned upon the arm of flesh; so that it may be said,
with the prophet in former days, one has builded a wall,
and another has daubed it with untempered mortar.
And I believe the day is coming, in which the wall,
which men have in their own wisdom and strength been building for a shelter to them,
shall fall, and the foundation thereof shall be discovered;
and both the builders and the daubers shall be confounded in that day.
For the Lord will overturn all that is not upon the right foundation,
in the day when he will arise in his power to cleanse his churches and purify his temple.
That we may be of the number, who may be able to stand when he appears,
is what my soul travails for.
It has often been before me of late, that such a day of trial is hastening on,
as will try all to the very bottom, and the strongest will not find anything to boast of;
yet I also believe, the weakest babes in Christ who keep their habitation,
shall be strengthened to go through whatsoever may be suffered
to come upon them for the trial of their faith,
that so it may be more precious than that of gold.
I do not see any need the faithful have to be discouraged:
for though there be a suffering with Christ for a time,
yet there will be a reigning with him also.
And though the followers of the Lamb may seem but a few,
and his enemies a great multitude,
yet the Lamb and his followers will obtain the victory at last, and triumph over all.

Whilst I am thus going on, I am ready to check myself,
why I should write after this manner to one who knows more than I do,
and whose experience far excels mine,
from whom I had more need to receive both counsel and encouragement; for I am often,
in the sight of things and the sense of my own weakness, made to cry out,
who shall continue to the end in well-doing, so many are the wiles of Satan to weaken,
and if possible, destroy the faith of God`'s poor children.
Surely we have need of one another`'s prayers; and as the Lord opens, strengthens,
and enlarges my heart towards himself, I am not unmindful of my near and dear friends.
I desire to be remembered also by thee,
and to be frequently visited by thy fatherly epistles, as freedom and opportunity admit;
and keep nothing back that may be in thy mind towards me,
for I have an open heart to receive good counsel.

12th of Fourth month, 1718.

The church is in my judgment in a poor condition,
and many of her living members are almost overborne and crushed by those who are in
such a state as renders them incapable of membership in that body which has a holy Head,
and is made all holy by the virtue and power which
flows from Him and circulates through every member.
But such is the declension of this age,
that I fear too many who are accounting themselves members of this holy body,
know very little what holiness is, at least as to the practice of it.
It is as if some now-a-days did not believe that text,
"`Without holiness none shall see the Lord,`" except they think
holiness consists in talking of good things now and then.
Indeed, talking is the highest attainment some are come to,
and by their fair speeches and feigned words they deceive the simple,
but cannot deceive such as have a true discerning,
and are minding more how they walk than how they talk.
For it is come to that pass now, that people must not trust one another by bare talking,
though it be with seeming sanctity;
but we have need to wait for wisdom from Him who is an all-seeing, all-knowing God, lest,
like Samuel, we think the Lord`'s anointed is before us, when indeed it is not so,
but rather such as are despising those whom he has chosen,
and are exalting self above the cross of Christ.

Such we have amongst us, who would sway in the church, and they do a deal of harm.
My spirit is exercised before the Lord in a fervent cry to him,
that he will fill his faithful people more and more with the spirit of discerning,
that so all such deceivers may be seen, and a hand stretched forth against them;
that the mischief which otherwise they would do may be prevented;
and this will help mightily to reform the people.
For I am fully of the mind,
that the greatest hurt and obstruction of God`'s
glorious work lies amongst some called ministers,
and such as are next in degree to them.

London, 9th of Ninth month, 1718.

Some of thy good fatherly counsel and experience would be
very acceptable and I believe profitable to me,
who am one that often wades as in very deep places,
and am in great sorrow and affliction for Zion`'s sake.
According to my sense and judgment, she is in a very mournful state,
and is rather going into than returning out of the wilderness.
And that which most deeply affects my heart, is,
that too many who pretend to be watchmen upon her
walls are exceedingly ignorant of her condition,
and instead of giving a faithful warning of approaching danger,
and seeking to make up the breach and stand in the gap,
are with might and main seeking to make the breach wider.
By this means a door is opened to let in a flood of wickedness,
which if the Lord God of Zion do not, by a mighty hand, put a stop to,
I am afraid will prove a flood of utter ruin to abundance +++[+++of persons.]
For surely we have cause to say, the day is come,
in which abominations are found amongst such as are
accounting themselves the messengers of our God,
and are pretending to act from the motion of his Holy Spirit; +++[+++who are]
stamping things higher than is requisite, even if it came from such as are,
what these only pretend to be.

When I hear such things, and also hear and see how loose, frothy,
and vain such are when in company, it greatly wounds my very soul, and I am ready to say,
Truth will never prosper in a general way as formerly +++[+++it did,]
whilst such as make so high a profession of it,
live and walk from under the power of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
This cross is very little borne now-a-days, except by a small remnant,
and these are by the others accounted a narrow-spirited people,
who say they make the way more narrow than there is need for.
But sometimes I am ready to fear, such have either never entered in at the strait gate,
or else after some time have returned back into the broad way again.
Such may well be numbered among some of old, whom the apostle calls foolish,
because they did not obey the Truth after it was revealed,
but having begun in the Spirit, sought to be made perfect by the flesh.
This seems to be the state of many in our day;
and what will be the consequence of these things is known unto Him that knows all.
For my part I do fully expect, that except timely repentance be known,
of which I see little hopes at present,
the Lord will bring a sore and grievous judgment
upon the professors of his Truth and name,
which will fully manifest the hypocrite and double-tongued.

And though the apprehension of this terrible day may be
ready to strike a terror into the minds of the upright,
and make them say, "`Who shall be able to stand in that day,
and abide the trials thereof?`"
Yet methinks, as in the administration of condemnation and judgment spiritually,
there is a beauty and glory beheld by all such souls as
are willing to abide the days of their purification;
so likewise, in the administration of judgment outwardly,
in order to separate the pure from the impure and the chaff from the wheat,
there will be a beauty and glory beheld.
And though the gold must pass through the fire as well as the dross,
yet the effect will be different, for it will destroy the one,
and make the other more pure and beautiful;
and though the winds blow hard upon the wheat, yet it will not be driven away,
but only the chaff, which is not fit to be gathered into the garner of God`'s power.
And in those days, precious unto the Lord will such be,
as in sincerity and true-heartedness have loved, served, and feared him above all.

The daily cry of my poor soul unto my God is, that I may be one of that number,
whatsoever exercises it may be my lot to go through
for the Seed`'s sake in this suffering day.
And as it is my cry to the Lord for myself, so even for many more,
and I do find it my duty to pray for my near and dear friends everywhere,
and I also earnestly desire to have the benefit of their prayers for me,
and in particular thine, my dear friend,
as knowing thee to be one who often goes deep in
spirit before the Lord on account of his people.
I also desire a full and free account in writing of thy present
apprehensions touching the state of the church in general,
that I may know whether we be like-minded.
I think we ever were when together,
and as we still abide near that Fountain of love and life,
by which we were made to love one another, which love is stronger than death,
we shall still abide in the oneness, and see by the eye of faith the same things,
and so be a help, strength, and confirmation one to another.

24th of Second month, 1719.

[.salutation]
My good and worthy friend.

Thy kind and acceptable letter of the eighth month, I received,
and was very glad to hear from thee; for I thought it long before I had thine,
and many fears did attend my mind concerning thee, lest thou hadst been worse than usual,
which thoughts are very afflicting to me;
for I am desirous if it be the Lord`'s will that thy days may be prolonged in this world,
for divers reasons which are often under my consideration when I hear of thy indisposition.

The Lord in his tender mercy look down upon his church in
general and the families of this people in particular,
and administer suitably to the present condition and circumstances of his people everywhere,
is my cry to him,
and preserve forever under the shadow of his heavenly
wing and in the pavilion of his power,
such as are bent for his glory and the good of his people above all.
For many are the poisoned arrows which the enemy is shooting at such,
because they stand as in the front,
and are boldly fighting with the sword of the Spirit
against the wicked one in all his appearances.
These true-hearted soldiers often meet with very close engagements,
by reason of so many who pretend to be of the disciples and followers of Christ,
deserting their master and starting aside out of their places;
and this makes not only the battle the harder upon such as dare not quit their posts,
but it also makes the breach the wider which ought to be made up.

How these expect to escape that woe,
which is pronounced upon such as will not stand in
the gap and make up the breach for the house of Israel,
I know not.
But it is to be hoped,
the Lord in his own time will arise for his own name and suffering Seed`'s sake,
which even groans and cries from a sense and sight of the abomination, which will,
if not speedily purged out, bring desolation.
And indeed desolation is already come upon many, who once knew a good condition,
and the greatest misery of such is, they are not sensible of their poor, empty,
desolate state, but, too much like some of old, are thinking themselves rich and full,
wanting nothing.
And such as these are very apt to set themselves on high,
and are speaking peace to their poor souls, saying,
"`We shall see no sorrow;`" when alas! the Holy Spirit is telling them plainly,
both immediately in themselves and through the faithful,
that they are deceived by the great deceiver of souls, for their state is quite contrary,
namely, poor, naked, blind and miserable, and wanting all things.

But O, how hardly doth this plain dealing go down with this wise, conceited,
self-righteous people; for with sorrow I write it,
there are very few in these days who have an ear
to hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches,
and indeed the voice and language of the Spirit is
very little to be heard in the church now-a-days.
For though at times the Lord is laying a constraint upon his true ministers,
such as mourn between the porch and the altar,
and they are made to open their mouths in his dread, being filled with his eternal word,
and they at times warn both professors and profane
of the day of vengeance which is even at hand;
yet when such have warned people, they, much like the old prophets,
are even as it were separate from all, and dwell in solitary places,
till sent again with a fresh message.
But in the main, the spring of the ministry is very much stopped,
and true ministers shut up, especially towards the professors of Truth;
yet we have abundance of preaching amongst us, but +++[+++chiefly]
from the letter which killeth.
This was much in my heart, as I sat in our meeting at the Bull and Mouth this day:
when things will be better I know not:
the Lord help and deliver his poor mourners for his own great name sake,
is the cry of my exercised soul.

Now, dear Joseph, I cannot well forbear giving thee hints concerning things of this kind;
for my heart is often very full in the consideration of the state of many,
and I take the liberty to open myself to thee,
well knowing thee to be one who travails for Zion`'s prosperity,
and can deeply sympathize with her mourning children,
who are often in deep sorrow for her sake, and are crying, "`How long,
O Lord! will it be,
ere thou take unto thyself thy great power and reign over all in thine excellent glory.`"
But although it is very unpleasant to see Truth trampled upon and under suffering,
and its faithful servants suffering with it; yet I do believe,
the greater its suffering is,
and the lower we bow and are baptized in a pure sympathy
with the blessed suffering Spirit,
the higher we shall be raised by the Truth, when it arises.
For it must arise and come into dominion over all opposers and gainsayers;
and blessed will all such be who are willing to keep company with it,
and not only to believe in, but even to suffer with it and for it.
I have sometimes thought,
it is not a hard thing to follow Truth when it is
exalted and triumphs over all and reigns in glory,
then many will speak well of it; but when it comes to suffer, be buffeted,
mocked and reviled, then comes the trial of our love,
and many we see who are not willing or able to bear these things.

Cork, 3rd of Ninth month, 1720.

[.salutation]
Dear friend, Deborah Bell,

Thy long looked for letter of the 1st of seventh month past,
by our friend Jonathan Hutchinson, came lately to my hands, and though long expected,
yet was very acceptable.
The contents is matter of affliction, in that thou had no better account to give,
relating to the affairs of the church in general,
as well as the dishonour brought upon the holy Truth,
by the ill conduct or management of some in high stations therein,
which I find has affected thee to that degree,
as to have influence on thy state of health.
I can in truth say, it hath also affected me under the consideration of these things.
What will be the end thereof, while the leaders of the people,
by giving hurtful or evil examples, do cause spiritual Israel to go astray and err,
as they did of old; and who,
instead of standing in the gap and making up the
breach against an overruling spirit of pride,
and eagerly, nay violently, pursuing and running into and after the world,
do themselves lead the way, and example the people into it,
and thereby bring dishonour and reproach upon the Lord`'s blessed Truth,
as well as lay a stumbling-block in the way of the weak and well inclined.

Surely the Lord is greatly displeased with such leaders,
and I do greatly fear his heavy hand of judgment will be stretched out against them,
as it hath already in a measure appeared by the late terrible stroke
given to that unbounded grasping and coveting after the world.
With what face, if they dare appear,
can such preachers pretend or preach that we are a self-denying people,
redeemed from the world, and that we follow Christ by taking up the daily cross,
when at the same time their actions and conversation give the lie to their tongues.
Such preachers and pretenders as these,
must and will most assuredly receive a double reward
due to unfaithful and negligent servants or stewards,
unless they greatly repent.
And yet, notwithstanding all this, Truth is Truth still,
and will stand over the heads of such, and remain forever.
The prospect and consideration of things as they are at present,
is matter of great mourning and lamentation to the upright in heart,
who keep their habitation in the Lord`'s everlasting Truth,
and who are not yet without hope,
that the Lord will arise and plead his own cause for his name and glory`'s sake.
Amen.

[.salutation]
Dear friend,

This goes to thee with the salutation of my endeared love in the holy Truth,
in which the Lord`'s people are near and dear one to another,
in which love I often have remembered thee since thou wast here; with the best desires,
namely, that as the Lord has, I am satisfied, bestowed on thee a gift for the ministry,
so on thy part, thou mayst answer his love by thy faithful obedience,
keeping close to the gift given thee, neither going before, nor staying behind it;
that so at the end of time, having done thy day`'s work in thy day,
thou mayst receive the recompense of reward laid up for the righteous,
even a crown of immortal glory.
I observe the great concern of soul that rests upon
thee for the prosperity of Truth in the earth;
and truly I think there was never more need since the breaking forth of Truth,
for all who travail in spirit for the welfare of Zion, to cry mightily to the Lord,
that he would be graciously pleased for his name and Truth`'s sake,
to raise up more zealous and faithful ministers and elders,
to stand in the gap and help to make up the breach against that flood of pride,
liberty and covetousness,
that has crept in and too visibly appears among many in the churches of Christ,--nay,
is even too much encouraged,
if not exampled by some who would be accounted leaders and elders of the people,
which has greatly saddened the hearts of the righteous,
who have kept their habitations in the Truth.

To Henry Jackson

[.signed-section-context-open]
Near Cork, 9th of Ninth month, 1723.

[.salutation]
My dear friend, Henry Jackson,

Thy truly acceptable letter of the 13th past, I received some days since;
and it was the more so, in that therein I felt a stream of the same love,
wherein we at first became acquainted with one another.
Oh! the extensiveness of the love of Jesus,
in the souls of those who are witnesses of it, is beyond expression.
It makes new acquaintance old, in that which is eternal; nay further,
in this love and life we have unity in spirit with the holy ancients,
who had their being in the world thousands of years before we were born.
Words are too short to set forth the excellency,
the nearness and unity of this Divine love and life,
whereby the souls of the faithful are cemented together,
and made bone of one another`'s bone and flesh of one another`'s flesh,
in a spiritual sense.
Here we can rejoice in one another`'s joy, and sympathize with one another in affliction.
I did rejoice with thee in the account thou givest of thy family,
and of the great sweetness and tenderness of spirit, in the love of God,
which were among you; as also that at the following meeting with Friends, and neighbours,
the Lord`'s bowing power and baptizing spirit did attend you together.
In this I rejoiced with thee in spirit,
and the more to hear of the great openness in these parts,
and that the newly convinced ones thou told me of when here, were joined with Friends,
and coming under a settlement in Christ their Teacher.
I can truly say, that I have no greater joy, than to hear of the prosperity of Truth.

But on the other hand,
my soul hath been often filled with sorrow and lamentation
to hear of the decay thereof in any place,
or that the testimony of Jesus, in the discipline of the church,
set up by the power of God, hath been let fall in the streets in too many places;
the mournful consideration of which, hath often deeply wounded my spirit,
and raised earnest cries to the Lord,
that he would be pleased to arise in the majesty of his power and
spirit in all his honest-hearted elders and younger ones,
in an extraordinary manner; clothing them with zeal and courage,
to stand for his holy name and testimony, for true discipline in the churches,
too much decayed or neglected in many of them;
and to which may be applied the saying of James,
of building up again the ruins of the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down.
Now, since I know the Lord hath engaged thy spirit in this concern,
and that I am myself oftentimes overloaded in spirit with the same,
and since I feel an openness in my mind in writing, to make this a long letter,
I will therefore fill a little paper upon this subject: for indeed,
as I love to receive long letters from my near and dear friends,
filled with particulars relating to Truth`'s affairs, so when I write to such,
I am sometimes apt to do the same to them, though it be in matters they already know,
as I question not but what I write will be to thee.

I say then, that the disorders and want of true discipline in many places,
have appeared to me to proceed very much from two great causes.
The first, is too much ease, indifferency and want of zeal in many elders,
some of whom did once know better things.
These easy elders, assuming to themselves a power in the government of the churches,
by their long convincement and title of eldership,
instead of godly and warm zeal against the growing of hurtful things,
and placing the judgment of Truth on them in their first appearance,
have in the room thereof, used smoothing and foolish pity, which, in the end,
hath helped and been one means to introduce a flood of iniquity, pride and vanity,
and undue liberty into many churches;
which I am satisfied might in great measure have been prevented,
if all elders had stood in their places,
and kept up the testimony of Truth in all its branches.
Such as these will tell us,
we must not be too sharp upon our children or other young men,
though they are inclined to be a little too fine or airy; we must bear with them;
we hope they will see better in time, and that the Lord will work upon their hearts,
as he did upon ours in the beginning; for we cannot change their hearts,
it is the Lord must do that; in the mean time we must draw them by love and tenderness.

And thus they go on with their easy and foolish, what if I say, wicked indulgence,
until a spirit of pride, liberty and stubbornness gets such root,
and is so fixed in such libertines, that they are past advice, or counsel,
of either parents or elders.
Then they set up for themselves, and tell us, there is no religion in clothes,
new fashions, this or the other thing, and that they will see for themselves,
and be convinced for themselves, before they put them away.
I could say abundance upon this head, which is needless to thee;
but yet I verily believe most of these things have been
originally owing to the lukewarmness of indulgent elders,
who must account for them in the day of the Lord.
It is very plain to me,
that such elders do want the true and equal balance of the sanctuary,
they want a true spirit of discerning,
and how to divide aright the precious from the vile,
where to be sharp and execute judgment, and where rightly to be tender.
We never read that the Lord pardoned any,
while they continued in a state of stubbornness and rebellion; no, no,
such are not in a state of repentance, and therefore not in a state for forgiveness.
But on the other hand,
we find he was very merciful and tender to humble and penitent sinners.
And as the Lord thus dealt and divided, and led his people of old to do the same,
so he does in our day, to make a right division.

There is more true love in close and plain dealing,
than in smoothing that which is for judgment.
The latter may be compared to an unskilful surgeon,
who applies a healing plaster to a deep and corroding wound,
that should be searched to the bottom;
for though the holy apostle in proper cases advises to comfort the feeble-minded,
support the weak, and be compassionate;
yet we find he also thought it as proper in the contrary case, to advise,
to rebuke sharply, to warn the unruly, and a rod too, where needful.
There is equality and proportion to be used in spiritual, as well as in natural things:
in spiritual things, the plumb-line of justice and righteousness is the equal rule,
either for judgment, or tenderness and mercy;
and both in their places are to be extended in due proportion.

The second cause of disorders in the churches has been,
by introducing or letting in +++[+++to meetings for discipline]
unduly qualified members to sit in judgment;
which also I believe is much owing to such elders.
These being admitted, have in time become great troublers of the churches, some of whom,
being able from their carnal and fleshly wisdom to use words, and speak fluently,
without a true sense of Truth, have with numbers of like spirits,
pleaded for liberty and wrong things, and by their numbers, noise,
and clamours have brought a cloud over a meeting,
and kept down the power of Truth from arising.
This I have seen in some places, to the great grief of my soul: upon which,
I have said in my heart, "`Oh! what will become of things?
how can they be remedied?`"
For without a regulation of such members,
the things of God cannot in a general way be managed rightly;
and I see no way for a regulation and purging out such members,
but by a dreadful stroke from heaven,
or the Lord`'s arising by his overruling power to keep down that spirit.
I have often thought, and sometimes said,
that if Friends everywhere kept to the leadings of Truth,
they would not admit any members to sit in men`'s meetings, +++[+++for discipline,]
but such as come under these three qualifications: namely, first,
that they be orderly in their conversations; secondly, consistent in their apparel,
and good examples therein, according to Truth; and thirdly,
that they are one with Friends in their spirits in the discipline of the Truth.
Such as these may be benefited themselves in such meetings;
and if they grow in the Truth, may be serviceable in time to the church.

I have, I confess, gone on thus largely, in an uncommon strain, in writing thus to one,
who, I am well satisfied,
wants no information in these and many more things of the like kind.
I have no reason to give, nor apology to make for it;
but that as I found my mind inclined to write thee a long letter,
so I let my pen run as things came into my mind,
yet very short of what I could have said on the subjects.

And though I have been thus large already,
yet I cannot well omit some further additions upon thy letter particularly.
_First,_ of the hint thou givest of thy poverty of spirit and desertion at times;
to answer this subject at large would fill more paper than I have to spare;
and therefore, to be but brief upon it, shall say to thee, my dear friend,
this is no new thing; it was so of old,
and is but common to all Zion`'s true travellers in our day,
and even to such too who have attained to some good degree
of growth and settlement in the Lord`'s holy Truth.
There is but one path, thou knowest,
for preachers as well as hearers to travel in heavenwards,
and that is the way of regeneration and sanctification.
The Lord is often pleased to hide his face, and withdraw himself for a season,
and to plunge those whom he intends for greater services, into great distress;
though none that travel in Zion`'s way can pass without it more or less;
and the Lord`'s ends, in more deeply exercising his peculiar chosen instruments,
are manifold.
I could enumerate many of them, but for brevity shall instance but a few; as first,
to make them sanctified members for his own use and service, by slaying, breaking down,
and mortifying the natural and fleshly part,
and bringing them into true lowliness and humility,
since nothing that is high and lifted up can dwell in God`'s kingdom.
And yet, the natural and selfish part, even in honest souls, is very apt to get up,
through abundance of openings and revelations.
We find it was so with the great apostle Paul,
for which reason the messenger of Satan was sent to buffet him and keep him low:
neither did the meekest man on earth wholly escape this temptation of self.

[.numbered]
_Secondly,_ by great tribulation the righteous gain patience, as well as experience,
so as in the end they learn not only how to abound without elevation,
but patiently also to suffer want.

[.numbered]
_Thirdly,_ the Lord does often hide and withdraw, as of old,
in order to try his little ones`' faith, patience, and dependence upon him,
and that they may learn to depend upon nothing at all of themselves;
but entirely as a weaned child upon him.

[.numbered]
_Fourthly,_ the Lord is oftentimes pleased to suffer the enemy to buffet, tempt,
and distress his peculiar instruments more than others in a common way,
and sometimes in an uncommon manner, with such temptations too,
that they seemed not to be naturally inclined to before; and this he does,
that they may be able to speak a word in season, as they are moved,
to all states and conditions.
And herein we have an instance in our blessed Lord, who, though without sin,
was tempted himself, and touched, as says the apostle,
with the feeling of our infirmities,
that he might be able to succour those that are tempted.
If then our Lord suffered and was tempted for that end, shall it be a wonder that any,
even the highest gifted instruments, should be so in an extraordinary manner; to the end,
that they also should lend a helping hand by their
own experience to others who are tempted and distressed.

====

The holy Scriptures are full of instances,
of such as had attained large experience in the things of God:
how many ebbings and flowings did holy David witness;
the book of Psalms are full of them.
We also find it thus with many other holy men, under the old covenant: then again,
under the Gospel, we find plentiful instances of the like.
The disciples of Christ, while he was with them, preached the Gospel of the kingdom,
did many miracles, and seemed so strong in faith, that they could die with Christ:
but then again, how very weak in faith were they at other times:
poor Peter denied his Lord, and all his disciples forsook him and fled.
Many instances might also be brought from the apostles,
of the sore fights of affliction they passed through; which are indeed needless to thee,
who knowest these things, without my information, as well from the history,
as thy own experience; and therefore I should not much wonder, if thou ask,
why all these things to thee?
I answer as before, I have little apology to make;
but as out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,
so out of the abundance of love and openness I feel in my heart to thee,
I let these things go, as they came.
And yet, we have examples from the apostles,
that they did not always write to the ignorant,
but sometimes to such as knew the same things,
in order to stir up their pure minds by way of remembrance.
I know by my own experience, that we are poor forgetful creatures of ourselves, I mean,
as to the sensible remembrance of past enjoyments,
without a renewing of the same life and sense in which we enjoyed them;
even to that degree, that what we witnessed yesterday,
when the life and power of Truth was up,
we are apt to forget the true savour and sense of this day,
if the power of life be withdrawn.

And now, in conclusion, upon this subject, when all is said that can be said,
I have ever found it safest and best, under all distresses, temptations, and desertions,
to be as still, patient, and quiet as possible; not so much as look at the temptation,
if we can help it, but let the boisterous waves, billows and storms pass over our heads.
This counsel I know is easy to give, but hard to learn.
However, we may be assured of this,
that the Lord will never utterly leave nor forsake his depending ones.
They are to endeavour to keep the word of his patience, in the hour of temptation;
but if we are restless and uneasy under distresses,
we shall certainly add to our sorrow and affliction.

As to thy hint of thy concern at Limerick, upon my weighing it in spirit,
when thou first acquainted me with it, I had good unity therewith,
and my spirit was in travail for thee till it was accomplished;
I hope good will come out of it: it had a great effect upon the people,
who were much dissatisfied with the recorder for his rude behaviour.
Thy service in this city was not only very acceptable to all Friends,
but I am also very sensible it was of great benefit to some particulars;
and I hope they will never forget or lose it, particularly to my son: he does, I hope,
retain the exercise he then fell under, to my great comfort.
My soul prays it may continue with him.

To Thomas Story

[.signed-section-context-open]
Cork, 22nd of Ninth month, 1723.

[.salutation]
Dear friend,

As the Lord is pleased to bestow upon some far greater
spiritual and natural gifts than upon others,
so he expects far greater services from such,
and that they the more singly devote themselves to these services,
whereunto he has appointed them; agreeably to the saying of our blessed Lord,
"`Where much is given, much is required.`"
Thus, dear friend, the Lord hath endued thee with many excellent gifts,
natural and divine, and he therefore expects of thee, I am satisfied, suitable returns,
and that nothing of this world or the encumbrances thereof should stand in the way,
or be obstructions thereto.
The apostle Paul, speaking of a soldier of Jesus Christ, alludes to an outward warrior,
who, he says, does not entangle himself with the affairs of this life,
that he may please Him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.
Such an instance may intimate,
that the ministers of Christ ought not to entangle themselves with worldly things,
but leave such to his care and provision, who takes care even of the sparrows,
that so at all times they may be ready to attend his call and service.
Yet all this does not hinder any from doing necessary business in the creation,
so that it be done in that true moderation,
which is only to be seen and known by walking in the light.

It is not in my mind to charge thee in any wise, by thus writing,
nor is it because thou dost not know them,
but to stir up the pure mind by way of remembrance;
well knowing thou hast spent a great deal of time, labour,
and travel in the work of the ministry; and I rejoice to find,
that notwithstanding all thy various exercises the
Lord has preserved thee alive in spirit to him;
and that he may so continue to do to the end, is the desire of my soul.

But though thou hast been thus preserved, yet by what I have heard,
thou hast in some measure fallen among the briars of the world,
which have scratched thee.
To these things I never lent an ear, beyond sympathy and charity,
not questioning but thou couldst in truth and justice
clear thyself against all such charges;
and yet I will here say to thee, there is still a nearer thing to be considered,
whether according to thy station in the church,
thou oughtest to have entered into any great things in the world,
however just and honest in themselves,
wherein there might be any danger that thy gift or
thy example to others might be less esteemed.
This is what I was truly concerned for,
lest this had happened to thee by going into great undertakings.
Though still I do not charge thee;
but out of the pure love of my heart and the esteem I have for thee, I write this,
that if there should be anything in it,
thy experience may lead thee to avoid everything of the kind,
that may have so much as a tendency to hurt thyself,
or lessen thy ministry in the church, either with great or small.

And now since I have been thus large and free, I will yet be a little more free,
and upon a subject that has at times given me real trouble: which is,
that some libertines have made use of thy name as a cloak to their own pride and vanity,
and running into the fashions of the world;
which has appeared in their long curled and powdered hair, flourishing wigs,
long cravats, many unnecessary folds in their coats, fashionable sleeves,
and cuts of several kinds, cocks and strings in their hats, with other such like things,
after the modes of the world.
The growing of these things in the church hath caused sorrow of soul in the faithful,
who well know, that Truth in the beginning led out of the world`'s fashions,
which are vain, and forever will lead out of them.
When such as these have been spoken with, they have answered thus:
"`There are abundance of ministers, elders,
and very honest Friends in England who wear such things,
as well as we;`" and they have particularly named thee as one.

Though I have not believed all they say to shelter and screen themselves; yet,
dear friend, shall I be so free as to say,
I fear they have taken some strength from thee.
For I have been informed by some who do dearly love thee and thy ministry,
that they have thought in some things thou goest a little too fine and modish,
and particularly as to thy hat and long hair, etc.
It is not that we place evil in wearing either long or short hair, considered in itself;
but when either are in fashion,
and that or any other thing is taken up by any ministers or elders,
though they be not proud of it, yet it greatly strengthens and encourages others,
who are inclined to pride and fashions, to exceed even in a greater degree.
Thus a minister or elder edging towards any fashion,
others will equal their extravagancy in their lesser things,
and with a sort of privilege and authority cover themselves therewith,
till by thus exampling one another and each exceeding the other in pride,
a flood of iniquity hath been introduced into the church,
whereby the ancient plainness of an old Quaker has been in some lost,
and in the end some have been so ashamed of the plainness
of Truth and the cross of Christ,
that they have run quite out into the world.

These things are so plain, that they cannot be denied;
and the consideration of them hath brought deep sorrow and mourning upon some.
And, oh! saith my soul,
that the Lord would lay a heavy and zealous concern
upon all the honest-hearted ministers and elders,
to endeavour to put a stop, and stand in the gap against this torrent of pride,
which has been so mischievous in the church;
renewing the discipline of the church against these things.
But in the first place, it behooves all such to be good examples themselves in all things,
and then they can the better and the more boldly speak to others.
The apostle advises the believers to take him for an example;
and though he tells us all things, that is, good things, were lawful for him,
yet that all things were not expedient; he therefore advises us not to please ourselves,
nor do anything whereby the weak may be stumbled or any tendency to evil encouraged;
but rather to follow the things that make for peace,
and the things whereby we may edify one another.
The Lord has bestowed diversities of gifts in his church;
he hath endowed some with a spirit of discerning, others as helps and for government, etc.
These seeing anything in any minister or elder whose
example therein may prove hurtful to the church,
it is their duty to advise and counsel such an one,
and his duty is to condescend therein, though he should see but little in it,
especially where the thing is not matter of faith but of condescension,
and there can arise no hurt from removing the occasion of offence.
The apostle Paul even exceeded this, when he would eat no flesh while the world stood,
if it made his brother to offend.

I confess I am apt to be prolix in writing,
and never thought myself a sententious or accurate writer,
but I am not much concerned about it,
well knowing I am addressing a true and charitable friend,
who will not put upon it a wrong construction;
and if there be the least thing therein that may conduce to stirring up the pure mind,
my end will be answered.
For the very desire of my heart is,
that as the Lord has gifted thee and made thee a
bright and shining instrument in his hand,
so thou mayst on thy part answer his love therein by thy obedience,
and by carefully avoiding anything that may in the least eclipse thy gift.

=== Extract from the Last Will and Testament of Joseph Pike, of Cork, Dated the 25th Day of the Month called November, 1727.

I, Joseph Pike, of the city of Cork, merchant, being but weakly in body,
but through the Lord`'s mercy of perfect mind and understanding; and,
although I am but weak in body, and arrived to old age, yet,
through the infinite goodness and mercy of Christ my only Saviour,
and by whose merits alone I hope for salvation, I can also say,
he has made me strong in spirit this day,
to give in my testimony to the powerful and virtuous operation of his holy light,
grace and good Spirit,
a measure and manifestation whereof he has given to me and all men to work out our salvation;
and which teaches the obedient, according to Holy Scriptures,
to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts,
and to live righteously and godly in this present evil world.
And by which alone, and not by any strength of my own,
I can with unutterable thankfulness, and in deep humility of soul, say,
the Lord my God has kept me to this day from falling
into the gross sins and enormities of the world,
and for which I reverently bless and praise his holy name.

But notwithstanding that, I freely confess,
that for want of my keeping so close to the guidance of
his Holy Spirit in my heart as I ought to have done,
I have very often sinned and offended him.
And whenever I so did, either in thought, word, or deed,
his holy light in my soul let me see it, and his Holy Spirit, which is the same,
brought inward judgment and condemnation upon me
for the sin and offence committed against him,
and by his righteous judgments within me, which is the baptism of Christ,
which all men must witness to fit and qualify them
to enter the everlasting kingdom of God,
I say,
by his righteous judgments and the assistance of
his Holy Spirit I was brought to true repentance,
and found remission of my sins, O blessed be his holy and everlasting name,
saith my soul!

And besides the blessing of his Holy Spirit, he, the God of all my mercies,
hath added blessings from beneath, namely, outward substance,
for the conveniences of life; which I can in sincerity and humility,
and without boasting, say,
I have received from the Lord`'s hand with great thankfulness of heart;
and have desired of him that he would be pleased
to give me a heart not to be puffed up with them,
and I hope I can in truth say he hath granted my request therein.
And I can further say in sincerity,
that I have not eagerly striven to be rich in this world,
to make my children high and great therein.
But what I have more earnestly desired of the Lord for them has been,
that they might truly fear and serve him,
and first seek the kingdom of heaven and the righteousness thereof; and then,
whether they had but little or more of this world`'s goods,
they would have the Lord`'s blessing with it,
which I esteem infinitely beyond all the riches of this world.--This introduction
to my last will I have chiefly made as a memento to you,
my children and grandchildren.
