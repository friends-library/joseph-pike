== Part I.

It hath, for a long time, laid with some pressure on my mind,
to write something of my pilgrimage in this world,
and of the Lord`'s providence and merciful dealings with me,
both spiritually and temporally, from my childhood to this day;
not only for the benefit and instruction of my children, for whom it is chiefly intended,
but for others also, into whose hands it may come.
To this end, things have been often revived upon my mind,
and freshly brought to my remembrance; yet I have hitherto delayed this work,
till now at length I could not be easy without doing it,
not expecting that my time will be long in this world.

As my children, grandchildren,
etc. may be desirous to have some information concerning their predecessors,
particularly my father and mother, I shall, in the first place, give an account of them,
not as to their nobility of birth, great riches, or grandeur in this world,
but of their being virtuous and godly people,
who endeavoured to educate their children in the same steps.
What I write on this head, I had, for the most part, from my dear mother,
who lived to the year 1688; my father dying,
when I was about eleven years and a half old.
My father, Richard Pike, was born in Berkshire, at the town of Newbury,
about the year 1627; his parents being of good reputation,
and having some estate in houses there.
My mother, Elizabeth Pike, was born in London about the year 1636;
her maiden name was Jackson: she also came of parents of good repute,
some of her connections having been chief magistrates of that city.

Some years after the Rebellion in Ireland,
the English government sent an army for the reduction of the country;
and in or before the year 1648, my father, then a young man,
became acquainted with an officer, a captain of horse, who was ordered over.
He offered him a small command, that of a corporal in the troop; which he,
after taking into consideration, accepted; at that time believing war to be lawful,
in a just cause.
He accordingly came to Ireland, where, in several military actions,
he behaved himself with great bravery and courage; and, while he remained in the army,
was much beloved by those who were best acquainted with him,
being considered a man of honesty, sobriety, and justice.

When the war was ended, he, with others, had allotments of land for their arrears;
yet he continued in the army for some time,
until he was convinced of the Lord`'s everlasting truth; and because,
for conscience sake, he could not use arms for the destruction of mankind,
he was turned out of the army, after which he betook himself to a country life.

On his marriage, which was before his convincement,
he considered of a place of settlement; and having been a sober, frugal man,
he had a handsome competency of stock to begin with; also,
being acquainted with and beloved by many of superior degree,
they procured for him a _custodium_, upon a place called Sarsfield Court,
about four miles from Cork;
a situation which at that time carried a prospect of considerable advantage.
It was, however, taken from him, after he joined in communion with Friends,
about the year 1655, when the Lord sent that faithful minister of Christ,
Edward Burrough, by whom both my father and mother were convinced of the truth,
as professed by the Lord`'s people, called Quakers.

But oh, how did the priests and professors rage! their envy, hatred,
and malice were exceedingly great against the appearance of truth,
and the professors of it; and little or no justice could Friends get at that time.
Then it was, that even some of those,
who had been instrumental in getting the aforesaid place for him, became his enemies,
and used their interest to have him put out of it again, illegally and wrongfully.
Yet, as he thus suffered on truth`'s account, he did not legally defend himself,
as he might have done, but quietly left the place.
After this he took a farm, called Kilcreagh, seven miles west of Cork,
where he lived for some years; and there I was born, the 15th of the eleventh month,
called January, 1657.
In the year 1664, they disposed of their stock in the country, and came to Cork,
where they kept a shop, and educated their children reputably, yet in plainness,
according to truth,
and in every respect they endeavoured to bring them
up in the nurture and fear of the Lord.

Some time after they were married, his father, not knowing he was convinced of the truth,
invited him over to England, offering to settle some estate on him,
if he would pay a mortgage that was upon a part of it.
Accordingly my parents both went;
and were received by their relations with extraordinary kindness: for,
upon their first embraces, my father`'s hat fell off,
so that his father did not instantly perceive he was turned Quaker.
But, in a little time, finding that my father used the plain language,
_thee_ and _thou_ to a single person, his father grew angry and sour,
and seemed to change his mind as to the settlement he had promised;
so they came back to Ireland, and never, that I heard, got anything from him.

Though the government was changed in the year 1660, when King Charles II. came in,
and the old persecutors were turned out; yet,
the same spirit appeared in the new magistrates, both in England and Ireland.
Meetings were disturbed and broken up, and Friends cast into prison.
Those who lived in this city had their share, many being sent to jail,
where some continued a long time.
Among these, was my dear father,
who with others being closely confined and crowded together, got a violent cold,
which in the end turned to a dangerous distemper; and growing very weak, the jailer,
not having suitable accommodation in prison for him, by reason of the throng,
allowed him to go home for some days, where he grew weaker and weaker.
I well remember, that Susanna Mitchell,
a worthy servant of the Lord and mother in Israel,
came on a first-day morning to visit him, and was moved to pray by his bedside,
with great fervency of spirit; at which season,
the power of the Lord fell upon him in an extraordinary manner,
greatly melting and tendering his spirit,
causing him to utter several sweet and heavenly expressions;
and though he was then exceedingly weak in body,
yet the presence and power of the Lord so strengthened him, that he arose out of his bed,
as one that ailed little, and put on his clothes,
in order to go to his dear companions and fellow-sufferers.
My mother, and others present, seeing this great and sudden alteration,
had hope that he would be again restored to health.
After having a good meeting in the prison, as one who was raised from his deathbed,
to give his last farewell visit to his beloved friends,
he returned home with the jailer`'s leave in the evening,
with little appearance of illness: his distemper however,
though stopped on him for the day, returned again, and he soon became exceedingly unwell,
and grew worse until the third-day following, when it was thought he was dying.

In this very weak condition, the power of the Lord came upon him in a wonderful manner,
so that he was revived and strengthened, as one that had new life given him;
and thereupon, powerfully spoke of the great love of God to his soul,
and the preciousness of Truth,
with seasonable advice and exhortation to all who were about him.
Thus he continued, with the Lord`'s power upon him, until he died.
He had a spirit of discernment,
by which he saw and spoke directly to the inward
states and conditions of most who came to visit him,
giving them counsel, particularly to some unfaithful professors of truth,
who had shunned suffering for it: he expressed himself with such power and authority,
that they were almost amazed, warning them to prize their time,
and in future to be more faithful.
He also called such of his children, as were come to years of understanding, namely,
myself, my eldest sister Elizabeth, and my brother Ebenezer,
and gave us heavenly advice and counsel, to fear the Lord, be faithful to Him,
and obedient to our mother--then, the Lord would be a Father to us,
and bless and provide for us every way,--"`and let,`" said he,
"`the blessing of your dying father rest upon you!`"

His words were so powerful, and so pierced my heart in particular, that,
as soon as he had done, I remember I went out of the room into another,
in great agony of spirit.
Some of his exhortations during the time of his sickness, were committed to writing,
and read at his burial; previous to which, it was advised,
that as he had been a prisoner,
his corpse should be carried to the jail and offered to the jailer,
which was accordingly done; and he, refusing to receive it,
it was then carried to the graveyard and decently interred;
his body being the first that was laid there; and with him, in the same grave,
was buried his youngest child, Benjamin, who died either on the same day as his father,
or the day following.

This was the end of that faithful man,
and sufferer for the testimony of a good conscience; and I may justly say,
that he was a virtuous, sober, and righteous man,
very exemplary in his life and conversation; a loving husband, a tender father,
a true friend, beloved and lamented by most, if not all that knew him,
so that even some of the greatest persecutors have been heard to say,
"`If there was an honest man among the Quakers, he was one.`"
I am firmly satisfied that he died in the Lord, and is gone to everlasting rest, and oh,
saith my soul, that my latter end may be like his!
He died in the fourth month, 1668, aged about forty-one years.

At his death, he left five children, namely, Elizabeth, myself, Ebenezer, Richard,
and Sarah.
My eldest sister was afterwards married to Henry Wheddon, merchant,
and died in the year 1693, making a blessed end.
See an account of her in [.book-title]#Piety Promoted.#

In the year 1682, being then in my twenty-fifth year, I was married to Elizabeth,
eldest daughter of Francis Rogers, a worthy and honourable Friend in the ministry.
We have been now, above forty years married,
and I never had cause for one repentant thought on account of my choice;
she having proved to me a most loving, tenderly affectionate, and faithful wife,
a true help-meet, a loving and tender mother, a kind neighbour;
of a liberal and hospitable disposition, free from covetousness, and above all,
one that feared, served, and loved the Lord.
I was at that time in pretty good circumstances in the world.
We have had fourteen children, of whom seven are now living; namely, Richard; Mary,
married to Thomas Beale, son of that worthy Friend, Joshua Beale of Mountmellick;
Elizabeth, married to Joshua Beale, brother of Thomas; Rachel, Samuel, Benjamin,
and Anne.

As I have had occasion to mention marriage,
it is in my mind to add something upon that head,
for the instruction and information of you, my children, or others,
into whose hands this may come,
it being the matter of the greatest importance in a man`'s whole life.
Marriage is a divine institution, and our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ says,
in relation thereto,
"`What God hath joined together let not man put asunder,`" Mark 10:9. So,
the true joining in marriage, is of the Lord, and his mind should be sought therein,
so far as we are capable of knowing it; and though in such undertakings,
we are not to expect a miracle to confirm it; yet the children of the Lord,
walking in his light, having the eye of their mind single unto him,
for his counsel in their choice, and with sincere desire to know his mind therein,
I do firmly believe,
his holy and divine providence will have a share in this great and most important affair,
and then the choice and joining will have the Lord`'s approbation.
But, alas! too many, even among our Society,
for want of first seeking the Lord`'s counsel, by waiting in his light,
to be directed by him, have, on the contrary, made either outward beauty,
a great portion, or worldly interest the very first object of their choice,
by which they have grievously missed their way,
and rendered their future lives uncomfortable.

To speak more particularly from my own experience, I can in truth say,
I earnestly desired to know the Lord`'s mind therein;
and if I could have known that he gave not his approbation to my choice,
I verily believe, though in the greatest cross to my own mind,
I should have declined the prosecution of my intention.
And therefore, for some time I waited with a single mind upon the Lord,
and with sincere desires in my soul, to be guided as he should direct me;
that if my intentions were not consistent with his divine will,
they might be frustrated some way or other.
And in my thus waiting in the light,
I found in the end great clearness and satisfaction of mind to proceed;
and it was attended with several signal evidences for my confirmation,
that my choice was pleasing to the Lord.
And now my thoughts became a little too much (though innocently) taken up with her,
and thereupon, trouble of mind came upon me.
This trouble, for want of more experience, I took to be,
that the Lord was not pleased with my intentions,
so that I could not see but I must wholly give it up,
which in obedience to the Lord I resolved by his assistance to do;
upon this my mind became more easy, free, and single in the thing.
Thus it was, several times with me; until at last by the Lord`'s light I saw,
that this was not for the thing itself,
but because my mind was taken up more than it ought to have been,
by which I learned experience, not only in this, but in all other lawful things,
that we ought to love them only in their due places, and the Lord God above all,
even with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our strength. Duet. 6:5.

It is very plain that too many unduly covet and love lawful as well as unlawful things.
Christ compared the kingdom of heaven to a marriage supper, to which many were invited,
but none came; they made excuses, one went to his farm, another to his merchandize, oxen,
etc., and a third had married a wife; these were all lawful things,
and good in their due time and place.
But Christ told them, He that loveth father or mother, wife or children,
brothers or sisters, yea, and his own life, also, more than him, were not worthy of him,
neither can be his disciple, and that he,
who taketh not up his cross and followeth him was not worthy of him; adding,
"`He that findeth his life,`" that is, in the inordinate love of those things,
"`shall lose it; and he that loseth his life,`" that is,
in denying himself of the inordinate love of these things, "`shall find it.`" Matt. 10:37-39.
Thus it plainly appears,
that those who were invited to the marriage supper, loved those lawful things, as farms,
lands, merchandize, oxen, and wives, more than the Lord,
and could not lose their life in the present enjoyment of them,
for the Lord`'s and the kingdom`'s sake.

Thus, a person of moral character, who loves father or mother, wife or children,
house or lands inordinately, they having too much room in his heart,
there is little room left for Christ, his life being more in them than it ought to be.
And if he cannot take up Christ`'s cross to the excessive love of these lawful things,
he certainly loves them more than Christ, and is not worthy of him,
neither can he be his disciple.
And let this be an infallible sign or mark to all those, who say they love God above all,
to try themselves by.
Most certain it is, that whoever loves or delights in anything beyond due bounds,
let it be ever so good or lawful, sets up an idol in his heart, and worships it,
without being a professed outward idolater, and this is confirmed by Scripture,
which says, that covetousness is idolatry.
By the above we may explain what Paul meant, "`But this I say, brethren,
the time is short; it remaineth, that both they that have wives,
be as though they had none; and they that weep, as though they wept not,
and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; they that buy,
as though they possessed not; and they that use this world, as not abusing it;
for the fashion of this world passeth away,`" 1 Cor.
7:29. In this frame of mind it is,
that the lawful things of this world may be loved and used
in free and single resignation to the mind and will of God,
and then Christ, our dearest Lord, will be loved, served, and delighted in more than all.

Perhaps what I have said may by some be accounted a digression.
I confess it is so, yet it may be instructive to you, my children, or to some others,
in their progress heavenward,
and indeed I find my mind drawn forth to make these digressions,
as so many incentives to induce you to a right consideration of what steps you take,
and that those you take may be consistent with the mind and will of God,
that so in the end you may attain the crown of eternal life.

This instance of my experience relating to marriage,
may be accounted strange by such as have known little of
the beginnings of the work of the Spirit upon their hearts;
but what I have written,
I have experimentally witnessed in this as well as in many other cases,
that when the mind has been too much taken up, and agitated about lawful things,
the tender Spirit of the Lord has brought trouble and condemnation upon me for it.

When I was satisfied in my mind, as to the intended choice of my wife,
I then felt bound in duty to acquaint my mother therewith for her consent,
which she readily gave me.
Then I acquainted her father, for his consent, which he likewise freely gave; upon which,
I afterwards made suit to her, and in the end obtained hers,
and the marriage was concluded to general satisfaction.

And here also, I must leave some further counsel to you, my children and your children;
that, as you proceed in the fear of God in this most weighty affair of marriage,
you will be directed to proceed regularly therein, according to Truth and right reason,
and will make no application, nor receive any,
until you have your parents`' consent to proceed,
who have both a divine and a natural right in your disposal.
As it is irregular, so it is also unjust, where any do first apply to the young woman,
and it hath often been attended with great trouble and disappointment,
as dissent of parents, entanglements of affection, and many other inconveniences.
I can with great sincerity say, I have not written my own experience in this affair,
to extol myself, but purely by way of instruction; for, if I managed rightly,
I only did my duty therein, and what others ought to do.
I know myself too well,
(through the Lord`'s mercy,) to value myself upon any performance of mine:
"`I have nothing to glory in, save my infirmities.`"
And further, though I was made thus passive in this affair, and in many others since;
yet I am far from saying, I have been so in all things;
but that my mind sometimes would be taken up and carried away,
more than it ought to have been; and then the holy light of Jesus would let me see this,
and condemn me for it; and oh! the trouble and anxiety of mind that would attend me,
with strong cries to the Lord,
that he would preserve and keep me out of the snares
and temptations of the enemy of my soul,
which, to the praise of his holy name, he has done to this day.

I also believe, that most or all God`'s people,
who at times have dominion in their minds, over lawful as well as unlawful things,
have had, at other times, sufficient trials of their faith, patience,
and love to their God, while he was pleased, as of old, to hide his face for a moment,
and to suffer the enemy to tempt and buffet them,
in order that they might see the frailty of their own nature; and, that,
without his divine assistance, they are poor, weak, miserable creatures,
and unable to perform anything, either in thought, word, or deed, acceptable to him;
agreeably to the saying of our dear Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, to his disciples,
"`Without me ye can do nothing.`"
In all times of weakness, temptation, and the Lord`'s withdrawings,
we are patiently to wait on him, remembering, that no man,
(not even the best of men,) by all his own strength, is able to help himself,
or to do the least acceptable thing in His sight, nor preserve himself for one moment.
It is man`'s duty to keep continually upon his guard,
watching and praying against the enemy of his soul, until the Lord arise again, lest,
as Christ said, we fall into temptation, from which none can be preserved,
but by the Preserver of men, who is God, and our Holy Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ.

My mother lived to the year 1688, and made a good end.
I loved her very tenderly, and carried myself towards her with dutifulness;
this she fully expressed on her deathbed, and of her dear love for me.
I can say in truth, that I have very often looked back,
and seriously reflected upon the whole course of my behaviour towards her,
and have found great peace and satisfaction of mind;
my conscience on the nicest scrutiny has not reproached me; had it been otherwise,
I am sure it would have lain very heavy upon me.
I write this as a memorial to all children in general into whose hands this may come,
but more directly and particularly for my own children and their children`'s children.
For, indeed, it is the incumbent duty, both natural and divine,
of children towards their parents, to obey them in all their just and lawful commands;
without which, they are not to expect the blessing, but instead thereof, the displeasure,
if not the curse, of the Almighty, which, I could abundantly prove,
by numerous texts of the Holy Scriptures.

If parents rightly discharged their duty towards their children, it might go a great way,
together with their own good examples, in making religious impressions upon them,
as well as in influencing them to perform their duty towards their parents.
But, through the failure of parents in both these respects,
I believe thousands of children have been lost,
out of which number I will not exclude many within the compass of our Society.
Abraham, for his faithfulness, is called the Friend of God;
and God gives this character of him, "`I know him,
that he will command his children and his household after him,
and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.`" Gen. 18:19.
And Israel was repeatedly commanded, diligently to teach their children,
and to tell their sons, sitting down, rising up, in the house, and on the way-side,
to keep the law of the Lord, and fear him all the days of their life.
David instructed his son to keep the law of God; and we find, on the other hand,
though Eli reproved his sons, yet, because he did not restrain them,
the judgments of God came upon him.
A father was to train up a child in the way he should go;
he who truly loved his children was to chasten them betimes;
and to bring them up in the fear, nurture, and admonition of the Lord,
and to have them in subjection with all gravity.
It most plainly appears, how great, how absolute,
and how indispensable a duty lies upon parents towards their children,
in order to their instruction in the way and fear of the Lord, by commanding,
instructing, correcting, restraining, admonishing,
and keeping them in subjection from their childhood--all in due measure, time, and place,
as the different occasions may require.

But, contrary hereunto, I have observed two sorts of parents, who,
by their own ill management, and not keeping their authority over,
and discharging their duties to their children,
as by divine obligation they are enjoined to do,
have ruined them with regard to all that is good.
The first are such, who, though they may be moral in their own lives and conversations,
and are no bad examples to their children, yet, by their foolish indulgence,
falsely called love, have thereby been the very means of their ruin.
A child may be not unfitly compared to a young growing twig, easily bent at first,
but as it increases in strength, becomes less pliable, and when it is a great tree,
is unbendable; and thus, most children when young may, by the godly care of parents,
be trained up very much as the parent pleases; or else, to what purpose,
were the above precepts given?
But, as evil and folly are naturally bound up in the heart of a child, so,
that evil nature, not being kept down or restrained by an indulgent parent,
gradually grows stronger and stronger, and in the end becomes past bending, and rules.

Thus, I have, with sorrow, seen some foolishly indulgent parents,
who were so blind as not to see faults in their children, or if they did see them,
through excessive indulgence, would not restrain them,
which in the end has proved their ruin.
No wonder then, if such parents should lose all authority over their children,
as well as such children disregard their parents,
for want of keeping them in due subjection,
as soon as they attain to any degree of understanding, which they will soon do,
to discern their parents`' fondness.
And, when too late, those very parents begin to feel the smart of their own folly;
and yet, by reason of their blindness, can hardly even then see,
that they have been the original cause of it,
for want of keeping their children in due subjection; and some have cried out for advice,
complaining their son is grown so disobedient, they know not what to do.
And yet I have known when Friends have gone under a religious
concern to such parents to give them advice,
instead of taking it well, as they ought to do,
they have been so blind and stupid as to return undue reflections; and others again,
who have taken it better,
would excuse themselves with the most plausible reasons they could invent, saying,
the child is wild and playful,
and they do not like to correct it as it has a weak constitution, etc.
Now, in those cases, it is my judgment,
that when such private admonition has been without effect,
it becomes the indispensable duty of the church to interpose,
by dealing with them more closely or openly; as the example of such parents and children,
is a hurt to our youth, and a dishonour to our holy profession in general, and,
as the wise man said, "`Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child,
but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him;`" Prov. 22:15. So,
foolish fondness being bound up in the heart of those parents,
the rod of church discipline should be used, in order, if possible, to drive it away.

But notwithstanding all the care of godly parents,
it has happened that some will be disobedient; for we find that Samuel,
a great and good man, had wicked sons, yet we do not read that he was blamed,
no doubt because he did his duty.
The difference lies here,--that, if parents do truly discharge their duty,
the children`'s blood will fall on their own heads; but on the contrary,
if parents by their indulgence do contribute to it,
the children`'s blood may lie at their doors.

As to the education and management of my own children, I shall not say much.
I love those of them who deserve it, very dearly; and,
when I have observed them sober and religiously inclined,
I thought them as near and dear to me as my own life: on the other hand,
when I have observed anything in them that tended to their hurt, such as wildness,
rudeness, evil words, or actions, bad company, or an inclination to pride or height,
or to this, or the other new fashion,--these things, I could not see in my children,
without duly discountenancing; and advising, reproving, or correcting,
as the nature of the offence required.
Neither does my conscience reproach me for conniving at,
or countenancing any of these things in my children; and I can, in sincerity, say,
that I have often desired,
that as they grow in years they may grow in the fear and favour of God,
more than to increase in all the riches of this world; and I bear my dear wife witness,
that she has been of the same mind with me, in all these respects.

As example very often prevails beyond precept,
and children are generally apt to take their parents for example,
so the example of bad and wicked parents is apt to prevail upon their children,
without an overruling Providence interpose; and to this cause, I believe,
is owing the great deluge of wickedness that has so much overspread the Christian world.
Yet, at the very same time, some of these men will in their prayers call "`God Father,
Christ their Redeemer, and the Holy Scriptures, their only rule of faith and practice.`"
Yet, I believe,
there are in all professions many parents who are sincere in their religion,
and are not evil examples to their children.

While writing the above, a mournful consideration took possession of my mind,
relating to the original cause, not only of the great wickedness,
which so much abounds in Christendom,
but also of the too great defection in those of moral and religious lives,
from the true life and inward power of Christianity in their hearts; while,
at the same time,
they mightily extol the Holy Scriptures with many extraordinary epithets.
Under this prospect, it appeared very plain to me, as it has often done before,
that this defection in both sorts proceeds from the want of truly believing in,
and being immediately led and guided by the Holy Spirit and grace of God in their hearts,
a measure and "`manifestation`" of which (say the Scriptures)
is "`given to every man to profit withal;`" which would,
if obeyed, make wicked men righteous, moral men better,
and in the end make both true Christians at heart,
and enjoyers of the life and power of Christianity.

It would lake up a treatise to write at large upon the virtue and
efficacy of this holy and divine principle of the Spirit of God,
for the salvation of mankind, through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
as abundantly testified of in the Holy Scriptures,
and also in many of our Friends`' writings.
I refer particularly to the works of our beloved brethren,
William Penn and Robert Barclay, especially to the latter, in the 2nd, 5th,
and 6th propositions of his [.book-title]#Apology,# upon Immediate Revelation,
and the Universality of the Light and Grace of Christ,
where my reader will find it very fully treated of.
