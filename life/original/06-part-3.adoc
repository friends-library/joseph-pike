== Part III.

As I have before given some account of the spiritual
travail and exercises I passed through,
and how by the workings of the Lord`'s Holy Spirit
I came to witness a growth in the Truth,
and thereby a concern to promote discipline in the church of Christ, I now,
under this third head,
come to give a brief account of my outward affairs and dealings in the world;
which I can truly say, I do for the instruction and benefit of my children and others,
into whose hands this may come, who make profession of the Truth;
that they may walk in the light which will lead them to keep in moderation,
within the bounds of Truth, in their outward affairs,
as the light of the Lord led me to do.

For want of this, many by striving to be rich,
have begun and run on rashly into great trades and dealing, beyond their abilities,
and have thereby hurt their own souls, invaded other men`'s property,
and been a stumbling-block in the way of the well-inclined,
as well as a reproach and scandal to Friends and Truth.
For the sake of such as are thus forwardly inclined, and for an example to my children,
it is with me to give an account, how gradually I proceeded in my outward affairs,
and how the Lord was pleased to bless my honest endeavours
with an increase of outward substance.
But let none mistake me; I do not here mean,
that every one should have an immediate divine motion to
every action they go about in the affairs of this life;
but as the light of Christ shines in the heart, and immediately leads, moves,
or inclines the obedient to spiritual things, and to their duty towards the Lord,
so also by the illumination thereof, such a light is afforded,
as will lead them into moderation, and keep them within the bounds of Truth,
so as not to run into extremes in trading and dealing, etc.
And though all such are not rich in this world, nor is it necessary they should be so,
yet as they keep to Truth, although they may be poor and low, they will never want bread,
according to the saying of David, "`I have been young, and now I am old;
yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.`"
And thus, though some be but poor in this world, yet Divine Providence perhaps orders it,
as what is best for them, and for their good; as saith the apostle,
"`All things work together for good to them that love God.`"
Such as these depend upon the Lord`'s good providence,
and are content in their states and conditions; and if they are rich in faith,
they are rich in that treasure, which is beyond all the possessions of this world.

On the other hand,
if it be the Lord`'s pleasure to bestow the affluence of earthly things on the honest-hearted,
they will receive it with thankfulness, and as a blessing from the Divine hand,
being ready to do good, and communicate to the poor and needy in their generation.
But if riches increase upon any, and their hearts are set upon them,
or if they are proud, covetous, or narrow-spirited,
their possessions become a curse to them.

When I was about eighteen years old, I received my small portion;
for although my father left us under pretty good circumstances in the world,
yet we got but very small portions out of it, which was mostly in shop goods;
these I sold off for about three pounds; and soon after, commenced trading in wool,
as I could reach to buy it.
The first bargain I made was for a bag, (about sixteen stone) of short fell wool,
by selling which I made about twenty shillings.
I soon after bought two bags of the same sort, by which I got about fifty shillings;
and getting a fresh stock, I went over to Minehead,
having been about a year in my little trade, where I continued six months,
dealing in wool for my brother-in-law Henry Wheddon, which I did to his satisfaction;
and then I made it my business to get full insight into wool,
for I delighted in the trade.

At that time I became intimately acquainted,
and contracted a particular friendship with William Alloway,
who was a very sober young man, which made me love him the more,
and with whom I became a partner; and so continued for several years,
dealing in wool and English goods, and we both got on pretty well.
By degrees my stock was augmented,
and I was in a better capacity to deal something more largely.
In so doing, I do not remember that I ever broke my word or promise with any body,
neither did I venture more in one ship, than I was able to bear if she was lost,
for I did not then, nor do I now look upon it just,
to venture or hazard other men`'s substance, let the prospect of profit be ever so great.

And thus I went along gradually, keeping within bounds,
not over-trading or much encumbering myself in the world,
and I lived frugally but not niggardly: and the Lord was pleased to bless my endeavours.
I did all my business with industry and diligence, not slothfully,
but according to the best of my understanding, leaving the success to Providence.
I can also say, I received the increase, truly as a blessing from the Lord`'s hand,
and with humble desires that he would give me a heart to make use of it to his praise,
and that I might, with a free and willing heart,
serve him with his own that he had bestowed on me; for I looked upon it then,
as I still do, that he had prospered me in the world for that end.
Thus I went on, keeping within bounds; so that in all my dealings,
from the beginning to this day, I never was much straitened for money,
so as to be dunned for payments I was to make.

I was married when about twenty-four years old,
at which time I had a pretty good stock of my own, and in addition to my wife`'s portion,
we received considerably more at her father`'s death; some time after which,
I joined my brother Richard Pike, in opening a linen-draper`'s shop,
being the first of the kind in the city of Cork.
We continued together for some years, and shortly after his marriage we parted.
I joined my brother-in-law Henry Wheddon, in the serge trade to Holland, Flanders,
etc. which we continued successfully to follow, until the war came on,
after which the Parliament in England took it wholly away.

After this I bought yarns, which with some other articles I sent to England,
trading moderately,
having always a regard not to hurry or encumber myself
in such business as fell in my way,
and I had thereby time to spare to travel to meetings, and serve Truth in my station.
I have often, with humble admiration, considered the wonderful goodness of the Lord,
in increasing my substance as he hath done,
with such ease and so little encumbrance to myself.
And notwithstanding I had at times prospects of considerable advantage, by which,
in human probability, I might have derived much more profit than I did;
yet if they seemed to be attended with hurry or encumbrance,
or would be ill examples for others to follow,
I have often declined the prosecution of such prospects,
notwithstanding I had stock wherewith to do it.

About this year or the succeeding one,
a prospect of very great profit offered itself of buying in tobacco,
there being abundance of it in town, which was imported and paid only the old duty;
but it was considered, that as soon as the Parliament sat,
they would lay the high duty on it again.
It was variously conjectured, as the debates thereon continued for some time;
however it made those who had tobacco on hand generally
willing to sell at the present prices.
During this time, my cousin Samuel Randall proposed for my consideration,
the propriety of our purchasing a large quantity, saying it should quickly be decided on,
as others would purchase.
I considered it, and was of the same opinion with him,
that there was a likelihood of making a great deal, and no apparent danger of losing,
but I had also considered what the people would say, namely,
"`Here are Samuel Randall and Joseph Pike, rich Quakers; they are grasping and covetous;
they cannot be content without turning monopolizers.`"

Though the thing was just in itself, and others might do it without reflection,
yet we could not, for the people would not only reflect upon us,
but by our means upon Truth also; and for this reason it was better to decline it.
This presently met with his approbation, for we were both of one heart and one mind,
in anything that affected the honour of Truth; and for that reason alone we gave it up.
In a day or two, another person bought most in town, by which it was generally believed,
he made several thousand pounds; for by the next post,
news came from parliament that the duty was laid on;
and thus we missed this large sum for Truth`'s sake, and I never repented it to this day;
for if it were to do again,
and that I was sure of getting the same profit which the other person did,
I would still decline it for the same reason.

From about the time the wars ended until this year,
I continued buying worsted and yarn to send to England;
and although I was not hurried in business,
so as to hinder me from doing that little service I might be capable of,
and which I was concerned in spirit to do,
constantly attending the Half-year`'s Meetings,
and often too the Yearly Meeting at London, and other journeys for Truth`'s sake;
yet business lying a little heavier upon me,
than was consistent with my desire for liberty, I therefore hired a person to assist me,
who was to carry on the trade with my stock.

When I had thus concluded, I considered that if I continued trading as I had done before,
it might bring some reflection on me, as if I were too eagerly pursuing the world,
and thereby give an example to others,
who were too ready to run into great trading beyond their abilities.
And therefore purely upon that account, I declined buying much,
although my stock and credit would have well afforded it;
that I might give an example to others, who run headlong into great dealing.
And such, my dear cousin and I did often plead with; who,
not regarding our advice and counsel, several of them failed in their circumstances,
and before this came to pass, they hinted to ourselves, but more freely behind our backs,
"`It is easy for rich men to advise the poorer to follow but little trade,
while they themselves have grown rich by trading:
when we grow rich we will leave off much trading too.`"
To which objections we have replied, let them but go on gradually,
and keep within due bounds, as we both have done,
and there will be no occasion to find fault with them; but they begin not as we did,
but rather where we left off.
And I have seen many such ruin themselves, and invade other men`'s property,
by striving after riches.
But notwithstanding I have often declined the prosecution of prospects,
that carried a fair appearance of profit, yet I will not and dare not say,
that they would have answered accordingly, by encumbering myself with business;
for the Lord, having blessed me in moderate dealing,
he might have turned his hand against me, and frustrated my expectation,
if I had overcharged myself with business,
to the hindrance of that little service I had to do for him.

And I can say in the sincerity of my heart, that I never inclined or strove to be rich,
or to make my children great or high in the world,
seeing the ill effects of it in others; but what I have always desired for them is,
that they may grow and increase in the Truth, and in the fear of the Lord; and then,
whether I had little or much to leave them,
they would have enough if they had his blessing.
I have no need to be concerned on that account for them; remembering my own experience,
that from a small beginning,
the Lord blessed my endeavours with the increase of this world,
in the contemplation whereof I have often been bowed with thankfulness of soul.
One thing I leave as a caution to my children,
that they always endeavour to have as little as possible
to do with wrangling or litigious men,
or partners, let the prospect of profit be ever so great.
This rule I have always endeavoured myself to follow,
and it has saved me a great deal of trouble; for I never had a lawsuit,
(though this may happen to many an honest man,) and but two or three arbitrations;
and I can also say, that I never wronged or cheated any body in my life,
for that was loathsome to observe in any.

I have been thus particular,
for the sake of my children and others into whose hands this may come,
that they may walk in the light of the Lord, which will keep all in the moderation,
and within the bounds of Truth, in their trading, dealing and commerce in the world.

And now, in the conclusion of this narrative of my life,
wherein I have not studied elegancy of speech,
while I endeavour to make things very plain,
which is more my intention than to set forth fine words, I can in sincerity of soul say,
that I have not written anything with a design to
exalt myself or gain the applause of men,
but from my being pressed in spirit,
in order to leave it behind me for the instruction
and information of my children in particular,
and others who may read it.

And in whatever I have done, or in whatever I was concerned,
as to religious matters or worldly affairs, that in any way appears commendable,
I did but my duty therein as all others ought to do,
according to their respective stations, for I neither could,
nor can do anything of myself, which I confess to the whole world,
that would be acceptable to the Lord without his divine help and assistance.
I have nothing to glory in, as to myself, save my infirmities.
And in looking back through the whole course of my life, I cannot but admire,
and in humility of soul commemorate the gracious
and merciful dealings of the Lord to me to this day,
both spiritually and temporally, far beyond my deserts; for which my soul and spirit,
and all that is within me, bows with deep reverence and thankfulness,
rendering unto Him alone, the Lord of heaven and of the whole earth, the honour, praise,
power and dominion forever!

Near Cork, 28th of First month, 1723.

[.asterism]
'''

After I had ended the foregoing,
I did not then think I should have proceeded any further;
but the Lord having been pleased to continue my life these five years longer,
I have made the following addition.

During the said time I have not been able to travel abroad,
but when ability of body has permitted me,
I have attended meetings for worship and discipline in town.
And a deep concern and travail of spirit remains upon my mind,
for the prosperity of Truth in the churches of Christ,
and especially for the church in this city;
and whenever I saw or heard of anything that went amiss,
or that any dishonour was brought upon the spotless Truth by any of the professors of it,
I was sorely afflicted thereat, even to that degree that it affected my weak body.

It came very weightily upon my spirit, in the year 1726,
to write another epistle to our National Meeting of Friends in Dublin,
held in the third month; and indeed it was a great cross to my own will to give up to it,
foreseeing that I must be pretty plain therein.
However, when it came to be read in that meeting,
it received the general approbation thereof,
and two thousand copies of it were ordered to be
printed and distributed among Friends of this nation.
The epistle is as follows.

My dearly beloved friends and brethren:

Having been for some time under a deep and mournful
sense of the state of many of the churches of Christ,
a weighty concern came upon my spirit, to communicate some of those things to you,
which have come under my consideration;
and I could not be easy until I had given up to do it.
And as I foresee what I shall write will be long, and the longer,
by commemorating the dealings of the Lord with us in this nation,
as well as mentioning some things new and old; therefore, I desire you, bear its length,
it being probably the last time that ever I shall write to you;
for I am but weak in body, and illy able to write at this time,
and in all human prospect, not likely to continue long in this world.
But however that may be, oh! saith my soul,
that the Lord would be pleased to preserve me near unto himself to the end;
that so at the close of my time, I may attain to that everlasting rest,
into which the elders, who have gone before me, are already entered.

And now, my dear Friends, I herewith send you the salutation of my endeared love,
in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which remains as fresh and fervent with me now,
in old age, as it did in my youth; but more especially unto you who travail in spirit,
being zealously concerned for the welfare and prosperity of Zion.
You are as near and dear to me as ever,
and I have unity with you in the covenant of love and life, whether you are old or young,
rich or poor.
In this love it is, that we are bound up together in the bundle of life,
being "`baptized by one Spirit into one body;`" and
in this love which proceedeth from the Spirit,
the true unity of the church is kept up and maintained in the bond of peace,
whereby the whole body is edified together in love,
which you know is a stronger bond than all outward laws, creeds,
or confessions of faith without it.

And besides this gift of the Holy Spirit, which Christ hath given us for our salvation,
he has given additional means and assistances conducive to that great end.
Thus he has afforded us the Holy Scriptures for our information, edification,
and comfort through the Spirit.
He has sent us his ministers and messengers,
whom he has furnished with the immediate power of his word.
He has gifted elders to oversee, advise, and admonish us;
and by his Holy Spirit he has moved upon both ministers and elders,
to give forth and leave us holy instructions,
for keeping godly order and discipline in the churches of Christ,
to be as an hedge and defence about us for our preservation, so far as means can be,
in this unity of the Spirit, as well as to keep us from the inroads of the enemy,
who goeth about continually, "`seeking whom he may devour.`"

Our gracious Lord has done all this for us in our day, as he did in former times,
so that we may truly say with the holy prophet Isaiah,
who spoke from the mouth of the Lord,
"`What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it?`"
And I pray God, it may not be said of many of us now, as he said to Israel then,
"`Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes,
brought it forth wild grapes?`"

Now, my dear Friends, that which bears the greatest weight upon my spirit at this time,
is relating to Gospel order and discipline in the churches of Christ.
And though I well know that you who have retained your first love to God,
and have kept your habitations in his holy Truth, do not want any information of me,
to convince you of the necessity and service thereof; yet,
as "`out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,`" so out of
the abundant concern I feel upon my spirit for the prosperity of Truth,
I beseech you bear with me whilst I ease my mind,
if it but prove of the least benefit to the younger in your meeting,
stirring up the pure mind by way of remembrance.
Notwithstanding I am very sensible,
that some of you want but little stirring up to your duty respecting the discipline,
yet I believe many others do; neither do you want to be convinced,
that our men`'s and women`'s meetings for discipline
were first set up by the movings of the Lord`'s power,
through that worthy, faithful elder, George Fox; and also,
that the authority of these meetings should be maintained therein.
You are living witnesses thereof, because the Lord has often owned your services in them,
by the overshadowing of his glorious power.

You know also, that in the first institution of these our meetings,
the members of them were to be faithful men, who were to rule and govern for the Lord,
"`such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness.`"
Exodus 18:21, answerable to those in the apostles`' times,
whom the Holy Ghost had made overseers in the church of Christ.
Yet this doth not exclude honest-minded young men
from being admitted to sit in those meetings as learners,
who, growing in the Truth, may at length come to have their spiritual senses exercised,
so as rightly to discern between good and evil, and things that differ.
And though at first they may not see into things so clearly as the faithful elders did;
yet as they grow in Truth, and follow them as the apostle Paul advises,
"`The Lord in due time will reveal such things unto them.`" Phil. 3:15.
I can speak this from my own experience.
Likewise, in a more general way, as there are, and always will be,
different degrees of growth in the members of the church of Christ;
yet as all are growing in the Truth, drawing one way, and aiming at the same thing,
namely, the honour of the Lord, and the prosperity of his holy Truth,
there will be a general condescension and submission to one another,
but more especially to godly elders and overseers.

Here the strong self-will of man is kept out,
and the unity of the Spirit in an heavenly harmony is maintained in those meetings,
as well as amongst the whole body, or church of Christ.

And while things remained in this order, the true watchmen for Christ,
those elders who were good examples to the flock themselves,
diligently watched lest the enemy should steal in upon them;
and when at any time he made an appearance, they gave the alarm to the flock,
to beware of the devourer.
Thus, if anything did appear contrary to Truth, of what kind soever, then, without delay,
these true watchmen endeavoured to put a stop thereunto;
then it was that things went well in general, in the churches of Christ.
I could enlarge abundantly upon the good effects of it, but in a few words may say,
that then the disorderly were dealt with in due time,
according to the nature of their offences, and for their good;
and if they could not be reclaimed, they were set in their places, Truth cleared,
and they made as examples to others; and then those examples became, in some measure,
a tenor to such as were inclined to follow their disorderly steps; by which means,
I believe many were deterred therefrom.
And thus, holy discipline was kept up in its right channel; and above all,
the Lord was pleased to own those services with his heavenly power.

But alas! alas! this state of things continued but a few years,
before the enemy of righteousness made attempts to break down the fence of discipline,
which had been set up by the power of God, and even prevailed on some,
who had been as leading elders and ministers, to be concerned therein;
such who once knew better things,
but had departed from their first love to Truth and zeal for it.
These men, with their libertine company in our bordering nation,
did rise up against that man of God, George Fox,
who had been made the instrument in the hand of the Lord to set up good order and discipline.
Against him in particular, they levelled their rage and malice,
and also against those who had kept their first love in general; but their chief end was,
to lay waste and destroy this good order and discipline,
and leave every one to do as they pleased.
They would have no bounds set, with this plausible pretence,
that all must be left to the light in their consciences,
and that Friends must wait until they were convinced
that such and such things were contrary to Truth;
though even many of the things they went into,
the light of Christ in the beginning led His true followers out of,
and to testify against them.

This was pleasing doctrine to libertines; it took with them, and they made use of it,
and thereupon went into a wrong liberty, such as height, pride, fashions of the world,
stiff-neckedness, strife, contention; and so unruly,
that they would not submit their differences to Friends,
with other things contrary to Truth, and too many to enumerate.
And yet all this was under the pretence of Christian liberty,
and that they were not convinced by the light in their consciences to the contrary.
In short,
the rebellion and confederacy against good order in the church was very great and strong,
and in some places they set up separate meetings;
but the Lord brought a blast upon that spirit, and they came to nothing,
as a body of people.
Yet notwithstanding this,
the seeds which they had sown in this time of undue liberty remained,
and still remain among many in some places;
and in this time it was that some of those seeds were brought
into this nation by examples from amongst them,
in particular, height, and finery in apparel and household furniture,
with some other things of which I am presently to speak.

Though I was but a young man then,
yet I was an eye and ear-witness of many of those things,
having attended several of the meetings in England,
wherein this libertine spirit raised contention;
and I then clearly saw the tendency thereof, that it would, if possible,
lay waste the whole heritage of God; and I bore my testimony against it,
as convenient seasons and opportunities offered.
I have written after this manner,
to show how good order and discipline were set up and established in a general way,
and what spirit it was that opposed them then.
I greatly fear the same spirit is at work now in this nation,
though under a different appearance; not by opposing all discipline as they did,
but by the breaking of minutes and the weakening of the hands of the faithful,
who are zealously concerned in spirit for the promotion of Truth,
and the keeping up of discipline in its right line.

In opening these things, I find I shall be still led on in a historical manner;
and therefore desire your patience;
for although it tend not to the information of faithful elders in Israel,
who know them already, yet it may to the younger,
by commemorating the kind dealings of the Lord towards us,
and stirring up the pure mind in them,
and that none of us may be ungrateful to him for all the
benefits and labour that he has bestowed upon us.

I have already said that some of the seeds which that libertine spirit had sown,
were brought over into this nation, particularly that of height,
and finery in apparel and household furniture, etc.;
and by taking example one from another, they got to a great pitch at last,
though not to the same degree as in the other nation, but we were going fast into them.

Upon this occasion I must revive the memory of that worthy elder, William Edmundson,
whose example and labours live and are sweet to the upright in heart.
He was (as most of you know) eminently instrumental in the hand of the Lord,
not only in a powerful ministry by word and doctrine,
but also for establishing and maintaining good order
and discipline in the churches of Christ.
He zealously and with undaunted courage, stood up faithfully for the Lord and his cause,
opposing all false liberty in its first appearance,
and was much grieved when he saw it growing in this nation,
faithfully bearing his testimony against it, without favour or affection;
and although he did so,
and many epistles and minutes went forth from our Half-year`'s
Meeting against that libertine spirit of height,
pride, and other things, growing amongst us, yet all did not prove effectual,
until at last the Lord blessed his unwearied endeavours with success,
as a chief instrument in his hand,
for putting godly discipline into due and close execution;
by which means a stop was put in great measure to that spirit,
until he was taken from us.

It is now about thirty years since the Lord raised up and spirited many godly elders,
to join with him as one man, in the work of reformation.
Thereupon, epistles were given forth from the Half-year`'s Meeting,
which named abundance of superfluities in apparel, household furniture,
the garnishing of houses, with many other things relating to conversation, behaviour,
and running greedily after the things of this world, which may be seen in those minutes.
And for the more effectually performing this work,
they directed us to choose out right-spirited Friends,
who had a concern upon them for the prosperity of truth,
and the putting away all such things as were like nuisances in the churches,
to visit every particular family, to inspect and advise as they saw occasion.

About this time the Lord raised a concern in the minds of the faithful elders,
in most parts of this nation; and with them,
had likewise been preparing the hearts of a younger and middle-aged generation,
to join in this work.
And when those epistles and minutes came down to this province,
there was a general assent in the minds of Friends to comply with the advices they gave,
as seeing the necessity of it.
I must confess,
that we in this city of Cork were at that time as
much concerned to take the advice as any in the nation;
for though our wives and children dressed pretty plain, yet many wore rich,
costly apparel, although of grave colours,
and many of our houses were furnished with superfluities,
not agreeable to that plainness which Truth led into in the beginning.
However, the Lord touched the hearts of those also,
and they joined heart and hand to the work,
first in cleansing their own houses and families from these things.
And after that, as elders were to visit families,
according to the advice of the Half-year`'s Meeting, some of these younger,
as well as others were appointed.
I well know it was very hard for some to give up,
thinking the service too weighty for them;
but having a concern upon their spirits that the work should go forward,
they at last complied, though in a cross to their own wills; and went in much weakness,
fear and trembling,
but the Lord (I testify) was with and strengthened them in the service.
I write this for the encouragement of all honest-hearted young persons,
who are concerned in spirit for the prosperity of Truth, and think themselves very weak,
and are thereby too backward in such services,
of which the faithful elders in the church may think them measurably capable.

It is with me to let the younger know how Friends proceeded in their visits,
in order to stir up their minds by way of information and encouragement.
The visitors being chosen, first met together by themselves,
and in the love of God impartially examined one another,
how far they stood clear themselves relative to those
things about which they were going to advise others;
and after due examination proceeded thus.
When we came to a family, we sat down, and first waited awhile upon the Lord; and then,
as it arose in the minds of any, we principally directed them in the first place,
to the gift of the Lord`'s Spirit in themselves,
as that by which alone they could grow in the Truth,
and which would lead them in outward things agreeably thereto, as to conversation,
behaviour, plainness of apparel and speech, etc. as it led our elders in the beginning;
and that although these things were very commendable in their places,
yet they would not do of themselves,
unless the heart also was right in the sight of the Lord.

Having spoken what was in our minds, according to the state of the family visited,
whether collectively or individually, as we saw occasion,
the minutes from our Half-year`'s Meeting were then read, and particularly spoken to.
And I may tell you of a truth, that in all the visits we made in this city at that time,
we met with no opposition or contradiction in any family or particular person,
but a general condescension in all,
and sometimes a free and open confession of things which had been amiss,
and that in great tenderness, with hopes of amendment for the future;
so that the visitors and the visited had great satisfaction in that service.
But above all, the Lord owned us therein, by favouring with his holy power,
so that in some families where things went well,
he overshadowed us by his living presence, melting us down together as into one lump:
may my soul never forget those times, while I live in this world!

After these visits were performed in this city,
the visitors went through the province also,
and there was in time a pretty full and effectual reformation;
and similar success attended that service in other parts of the nation.
Thus things stood for several years, and there was great unity amongst Friends,
and the Lord was pleased therewith,
which he oftentimes manifested by the overflowings
of his divine power in the meetings of Friends.

My writing after this manner looks rather more like a history than an epistle;
but I desire you will bear with me, it being to magnify the lovingkindness of the Lord,
in rehearsing his dealings with us,
and for the information and encouragement of the younger,
that they may follow the steps of those worthy ancients who have followed Christ;
shunning that libertine spirit which I fear is now getting in again, and has got in,
endeavouring to throw down and lay waste what our
godly elders had reared up by the power of the Lord.
And from this fear, I am led to query after this manner;--Are there not some amongst you,
who not only saw those times of outward reformation, but also heartily joined therein,
by putting away out of their houses and families,
those superfluities in fineness of apparel and household furniture and other things?
I am satisfied there are.
Or are there any who since that time have owned that concern,
and for a time stood zealous for the plainness of Truth?
I am persuaded there are.
And now I would query, are there any of late times, of both sorts,
who have lost their former zeal,
and suffered or permitted some of the same or greater superfluities in apparel,
to be worn by their children, and in their families; and have likewise suffered as fine,
or finer house furniture and garnishing to come into
their own houses or those of their children,
which they might have prevented, by zealously standing against it?
And moreover, have they not connived at others, who have gone into such things?
I fear there are such.
By these and the like means, and by taking example one from another, the seeds of height,
pride and vanity,
have grown and spread more among us than ever they did before that time of reformation,
to the wounding and grieving the souls of the upright in heart.

Oh! Friends! Friends!
I have this to say to you,
from the movings of the Spirit of the Lord in my
heart,--How will you answer it in the day of account?
You that by your ease and lukewarmness have let in those offensive things upon us again;
for as our blessed Lord said,
"`Whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me,
it were better for him that a mill stone were hanged about his neck,
and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.`"
What then will be the portion of such as these?
Therefore let all who are concerned therein, repent, and do their first works,
before it be too late.

And beside height, pride and fashions,
which have appeared in too many with a daring face, are there not those,
who have nearly lost, or been ashamed of the plain language,
both in speaking and writing?
Are there not some who have gone into undue liberty of many kinds,
and others who would be accounted something,
who have gone into contentions and differences, through a covetous and selfish spirit,
to the trouble of the church?
I wish there may not be such.
But I cannot well pass by this spirit of covetousness without remarking,
that it is an abominable evil in the sight of the Lord.
Christ himself severely reprehended it, and cautioned to beware thereof.
His holy apostle called it idolatry, and the former prophets cried out against it,
as did also our worthy elder William Edmundson, often warning us to beware thereof;
for where it takes deep root in the heart, it becomes a merciless, devouring spirit,
not only endeavouring to devour others,
but even destroying that man who gives way unto it, and very little can stand before it:
therefore beware thereof wherever it appears!

And lastly, I now query in a more general manner.
Are there not some,
who were once very zealous and stood against all these things I have mentioned, who,
if they had kept their habitations in the Lord`'s holy Truth,
might have been made serviceable instruments in his hand,
and as bright stars in the firmament of his power, joining hand to hand,
and putting shoulder to shoulder, to help the faithful in keeping out these things;
by which means, I am persuaded they would in great measure have been kept out?
And have not some of these, of late years, given way to those things themselves,
and are there not others who have stood easy and unconcerned in mind,
while they have beheld this departure;
and instead of helping the zealous and upright in heart,
have rather clogged and weakened their hands,
by openly or secretly abetting the cause of the wrong spirited and the disorderly,
so far as they were able,
and thereby have sometimes warded off the stroke of justice and judgment,
in the way of discipline,
and hindered the line thereof being stretched over such in due time,
according to the nature of their offences?
For if right time be not observed, right services may be lost.
Whereas, if true discipline had been duly and rightly executed,
it might have tended to the good of such offenders themselves,
as well as the deterring others from following their steps; but above all,
it would have kept up and established good order and discipline
in its right line in the church of Christ.

The obstructing or breaking of this right line of discipline, has produced, I fear,
a partial conniving amongst some; for have not the easy, lukewarm, and indifferent,
who have lost their first love, daubed with untempered mortar,
in endeavouring to screen and defend the covetous, and those who trouble the church?
And on the other hand, have not such joined with the lukewarm daubers,
when they have been justly found fault with?
and then, both sorts have been easy with the high, proud, and libertines,
who also in their turn, as they had opportunity, have defended the rest;
and thus they have strengthened one another, contrary to that most solemn charge,
which the apostle Paul gave to Timothy, with regard to the management of church affairs,
namely, "`I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels,
that thou observe these things without preferring one before another,
doing nothing by partiality.`"
Such as these are men for God, and right judges for him;
they cannot swerve or be partial to any party, persons, or even the nearest relations,
for favour, affection, or worldly ends.
But as to those who are easy, lukewarm, partial, or cold,
or such as are troublers of the church of God, who once knew better things,
I have this in my heart to say,--The Lord`'s controversy is against them,
whether they pretend to be teachers of others, or elders,
and he will dreadfully plead with such, above others;
for they may not only have their own blood to answer for, but also the blood of others.
Therefore, let such repent in time, before it be too late.
If any think me too sharp in what I write, I may tell them, it is no pleasing work to me,
for I do it in the cross to my own will; the day calls for plain dealing,
and I must discharge my conscience.

But as for you, my dear Friends, who have retained your first love to God,
and have stood zealously for the Lord and his Truth, whether you are ministers or elders,
young or old, what I write touches you not;
therefore I verily believe you will not be offended at it;
you can discern from what spirit I write.
And notwithstanding I have enumerated many hurtful things,
which have prevailed upon some who have been unwatchful,
yet I hope none will mistake me so far, as that thereby I mean the generality of Friends,
which I am far from doing;
for I believe and know that the Lord has still a faithful people in this nation,
which I hope he will preserve to the end.

Moreover, I have this in particular to say unto you,
who go mourning under the burden of these things:--Be not too much discouraged,
though some of your brethren, that should have helped you,
have left you:--it was so of old.
Remember that servant of the Lord, Moses, how often he was brought into great straits,
by the opposition he met with from rebellious Israel;
yet the Lord stood by him and carried him through to the end.
Remember the prophets Elijah, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah, with others,
who sometimes thought they stood alone, yet the Lord stood by them,
and likewise carried them through.
Remember Paul, who said to Timothy upon one occasion, that no man stood with him,
and all they of Asia had turned from him.
And he oftentimes met with great opposition and discouragements,
yet the Lord stood by him, and carried him through all.
These may be as examples and encouragement to you: therefore slack not your hands,
be not dismayed because of the oppositions and discouragements you meet with;
stand your ground, and be zealous for the Lord and his testimony;
and although you cannot do all you desire, yet do all you can,
and the Lord will stand by you, and do for you as he did for those formerly.

Dear Friends, there is another subject of great consequence,
that I have not yet mentioned, which has done abundance of mischief in the church,
namely, the fondness and indulgence of many parents to their children,
in giving them their own way and wills so long,
until the root of evil has grown and spread itself into many evil branches,
and at length, they have been alienated from Truth and Friends.
I could enlarge abundantly upon the evil effects of this fond indulgence;
but that I have been so large already on other matters,
and that we have so many advices against it.
However, I say,
that though some godly parents have discharged their duty to their children,
which has not had the desired effect, yet these will be clear of their blood;
but I believe too many have not performed their duty, by which neglect,
their children have taken wrong liberty and fallen into hurtful things:
such parents must be accountable for it in the day of the Lord.

I have already spoken of admitting young men into our meetings for discipline,
yet have this to add,--not as your director,
but as believing it is what Truth will lead all right spirited Friends into,
in every quarter,--Be very careful in admitting any,
unless they come under the following qualifications.
First, they should be sober and orderly in conversation; secondly,
they should be plain and exemplary in their habit and apparel, and no tattlers;
and thirdly, so far as Friends can have a sense of their spirits,
they should judge whether they will be condescending to godly elders,
and not be likely either in words or spirit to oppose them: for I have observed some,
who have been admitted without these qualifications,
have in time proved great troublers to the church, especially if they had fluent tongues;
and this I have beheld in some places in my travels, to the grief of my soul.

Another thing I may also observe:
we have a great many young and middle-aged persons amongst us,
who are orderly in their conversation, and wish well to the prosperity of Truth;
and yet are, as I may term it, either indolent,
or too much encumbered with the things of this world,
and thereby are backward in coming up into that service for Truth,
of which they might otherwise have been capable,
were their spiritual senses rightly exercised;
but this backwardness occasions their senses to grow dull for want of use.
I believe it will become the duty of godly elders,
to stir up such to mind the gift that is in them,
and if need be even to rouse them up to their duties, as well for their own good,
as the service they may have for the Truth.

And now, dear Friends, one thing more bears with weight upon my mind,
and I could not be easy without touching upon it;
if it only tend to caution the younger ones, my end will be answered; and that is,
relating to the close joining in familiarity with any dark, opposite, and unruly spirits.
You know we have advices against it, and the apostle Paul was of the same mind,
when he advised to have no company with any, who obeyed not their word by that epistle,
2 Thess. 3:14; yet in that case, he adviseth not to count such as an enemy,
but to admonish him as a brother: but positively commands,
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to withdraw from every brother that walketh disorderly,
and not after the tradition received of the apostle,
and likewise to have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,
but reprove them.

Now if any who walk orderly and are in fellowship with Friends,
contract a very intimate and unnecessary familiarity
with persons of dark or opposite spirits,
I believe it will have the following bad effects:--it
may rather strengthen them in that spirit,
than help to reclaim them from their opposition;
and may harden them in prejudice against those who have kept firm against wrong things;
besides the effect of ill example and hurt to others,
who are inclined to follow the steps of the unfaithful.
But beyond all this,
I have observed that even the orderly themselves have been greatly hurt,
and at last some of them lost thereby; for these,
having frequent opportunities of conversing together,
and hearing the continual buzzing of things against the faithful,
the orderly have in time lent an ear to them,
whereby surmises and jealousies have been begotten,
then hardness and prejudice have entered, and lastly,
a joining in confederacy with dark spirits against those who have nothing
more in view than the honour of the Lord and the good of souls;
and by this very means, in the time of the separation,
many who at first were honest-minded, were caught in this snare,
and some in this nation also.
Therefore I hope the orderly will observe our minutes,
and the advice and commands of the apostles;
and should they have occasion to converse with any of the other sort,
let them keep upon their watch,
and behave towards them as towards such as are under admonition; for Truth, I am sure,
will lead thereto.

And now I shall conclude, in much brotherly love, your dear friend,

Joseph Pike.

Cork, 2nd of Third Month, 1726.

+++[+++The following little circumstance has been unintentionally
omitted to be inserted in its proper place,
and forms a strong contrast with the sentiments of those,
who being trained up in plainness, are so ready to throw it off.
Thomas Story, much esteemed in his day for the work`'s sake to which he was devoted,
in the course of a visit in Gospel love to Friends in Ireland, landed at Cork in 1716;
and being much fatigued came to Joseph Pike`'s, where he found a kind and open reception,
and the refreshment he stood in need of.

It being the time of the assizes, +++[+++he writes,]
many of the higher ranks were in town on that occasion;
with some of whom our friends were acquainted.
One day, there came to my friend Joseph Pike`'s to dinner,
the young Countess of Kildare and her maiden sister, and three others of the gentry.
Upon this occasion, we had some free and open conversation,
in which they commended the plain dress of our women, as the most decent and comely,
wishing it were in fashion among them.
Upon this I told her, that she and the rest of her quality,
standing in places of eminence, were the fittest to begin it,
especially since they saw a beauty in it,
and would be sooner followed than those of lower degree.
To this she replied, "`If we should dress ourselves plain, people would gaze at us,
call us Quakers, and make us the subject of their discourse and town talk;
and we cannot bear to be made so particular.`"
I answered, '`The cause is so good, being that of truth and virtue,
if you will espouse it heartily upon its just foundation,
a few of you would put out of countenance, with a steady and fixed gravity,
abundance of the other side, who have no bottom but the vain customs of the times;
and you will find the satisfaction in it, an overbalance to all you can lose,
since the works of virtue and modesty carry in them
an immediate and perpetual reward to the worker.`"

This seemed not unpleasant, being said in an open freedom: but then,
alas! all was quenched at last by this;--all of them alleged,
"`that our own young women of any note about London and Bristol went as fine as they,
with the finest of silks and laced shoes,
and when they went to Bath made as fine a show as any.`"
Not knowing but some particulars might give too much occasion for this allegation,
it was trying; but with some presence of mind I replied,
"`I have been lately at London and Bristol, and also at Bath,
and have not observed any such; but at all these places,
Friends are generally pretty plain,
and many of them even of the younger sort very well on that account;
but such among us who take such liberties, go beside their profession,
and are no examples of virtue, but a dishonour and reproach to our profession,
and a daily exercise to us; and I hope you will not look at the worst,
since amongst us everywhere,
you may find better and more general examples of virtue and plainness.`"--[.book-title]#Story`'s Journal,#
fol. p. 533.--__Editor.__]

In the tenth month, 1726, I caught a violent cold, and was affected with the asthma,
so that I was obliged to sit up in a chair for about six weeks; after which,
the gout seized me violently, likewise the palsy in my tongue and right hand,
so that I could not speak for some time,
and was confined to bed for about twelve or thirteen weeks,
during which time I was not able to move my feet, and scarcely my hands,
and very few thought I could recover.
However, it was hid from me, whether I should live or die:--but,
oh! forever magnified and praised be the holy name of the Lord!
he did not leave or forsake me in this time of my great weakness,
and extreme pain of body; for his dew rested almost continually upon me,
and the sweet incomes of his living and comfortable presence supported me under all;
so that my bed of suffering was very often made as a bed of pleasure.
I was also preserved from the least repining or murmuring thought;
being enabled to bless that hand, which had permitted this affliction of body.
I was also favoured with the evidence of his holy Spirit witnessing with my spirit,
that I never joined with, or strengthened the hands of wrong or libertine spirits,
which was a great comfort to me at that time;
nor did I ever seek my own honour or the applause of men,
in all the little services I did in transacting the discipline.
Yet after all, I am but an unprofitable servant,
and not able of myself to do the least thing acceptable to the Lord,
without his divine assistance.

Oh! saith my soul, that my tongue may cleave to the roof of my mouth,
before I ever forget, to the last moment of my life,
that time of his wonderful love to me,
or his tender mercies extended to me all my life long unto this day!
And in the commemoration and divine sense thereof, I do, at this instant,
reverently bow myself, as with my mouth in the dust,
in humble praises to his holy and righteous name, for all his manifold mercies,
who is the Lord of heaven and of the whole earth;
who lives and reigns forever and evermore!

The Lord was pleased to raise me up again,
so that I went abroad in about six or seven months`' time, in this year, 1727,
and am still in the land of the living; yet how long I shall be so,
is in his divine hand, for I am but weak in body, though I hope strong in spirit;
and am now waiting for my dissolution, when the Lord shall please to call me.
I pray unto him, with all the powers of my soul, for preservation to the end,
and that I may be truly prepared for that sure, though uncertain hour, whenever it comes.

Joseph Pike.

From my house, at the Well, near Cork, this 10th of third month, 1728,
in the 71st year of my age.
